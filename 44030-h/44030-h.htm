<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Denmark</span> means "Land of dark woods."
Although one of the smallest states of Europe,
the little kingdom of Denmark holds a very
large place in the world's history, having supplied
rulers for many of the countries of Europe.</p>

<p>The Dane loves his beautiful country, the
land of Thorvaldsen and of Hans Christian
Andersen, of blue lakes, and "fairy-tale" castles.</p>

<p>Since the days of Leif and Biarne, Denmark
and the United States have been allied, and
therefore I feel sure that the children of America
will be interested in the story of their little
Danish Cousin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish to express grateful acknowledgment
to Hr. Georg Beck, Consul for Denmark in
Chicago; also to Mr. Haakon Arntz, and to
Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Andersen, for generous
information given in regard to the manners and
customs of the Danish people.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE DISTINGUISHED VISITOR</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hurtig!</span> <i>kaere Karen, mit lommetørklæde!</i>"</p>

<p>Fru Oberstinde Ingemann and her little
flaxen-haired daughter, Karen, were sitting at
their embroidery work in the deep window-seat
that made one whole side of the cozy Ingemann
living-room overlooking the Botanical Gardens.
Between stitches, Karen was watching the rain
patter on the little diamond window-panes, now
and then pausing to take a quick look at some
favorite newly-blossomed flower in the brilliant,
long line of window-boxes which bordered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
windows "like a long bright ribbon," as Karen
said.</p>

<p>The bell rang.</p>

<p>"<i>Hurtig! kaere Karen, mit lommetorklaede!</i>"
sounds like something terrible, but
Fru Ingemann was only saying in Danish:
"Quick, dear Karen, my handkerchief!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Karen," said the lady, as the
fair child replaced the sheer bit of linen in her
mother's hand with a pretty courtesy, for Karen
was a well-bred little girl.</p>

<p>It was a morning of excitement for Fru Else
Ingemann. Two important letters had come to
her from over the seas. One had come from
Chicago in far-away America, saying that her
brother-in-law, the Hon. Oscar Hoffman, was
coming once more to pay a visit to dear old
Denmark. Mr. Hoffman was an important
man in America. He was the president of the
"Danish-American National Park" in north
Jutland, and it was in his loyal Danish brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that the whole idea of the great Park had originated.
It had been his dream to save to the
glory of Denmark, for all time to come, a wonderful,
wild tract of heather-covered hills
where, year by year, thousands of loyal Danish-Americans
might meet in the Fatherland, and
celebrate America's Independence Day on Danish
soil. At last the Park was a reality, and
he was coming to make necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>He was bringing his son, Karl, with him,
and, while they were to be in Copenhagen, they
would spend their time with the Ingemanns.
He hoped that the little cousins would become
great friends. They would arrive in Copenhagen
on Saturday. To-day was Thursday.</p>

<p>The other exciting message came from Fru
Ingemann's favorite brother, Hr. Thorvald
Svensen. It was postmarked Rome, Italy, and
informed her that at last he was coming back
to live in his dear old home in Copenhagen, and
that he would arrive on that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Hr. Svensen had been living in Rome for
eight long years, and in those years of persistent,
hard work he had finally realized his
one great ambition, and become Denmark's
greatest sculptor&mdash;greatest, at least, since the
day of Denmark's beloved Thorvaldsen, whose
namesake he was.</p>

<p>To Fru Ingemann there was no more welcome
news in all the world. His letter said
that he longed to see her and the children once
more.</p>

<p>Little Valdemar, who was the sculptor's
godson, was wild with joy. "Let me stay
home from school to-day, mother!" he implored.</p>

<p>"No, no, Valdemar," firmly answered his
mother, as she handed him his school luncheon,
a box of delicious <i>smörrebröd</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> When Valdemar's
mother said "No, no," he knew that
further protests were useless. So he kissed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and was off, calling back: "Good-bye, mother
dear; keep <i>Gudfar</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Thor until I come home
from school, <i>please!</i>"</p>

<p>All that morning Fru Ingemann flew about
in happy expectancy, making more cozy the
pretty little apartment. Karen could hear her
mother, as she worked, singing softly those
familiar old lines from Baggesen, the well-known
Danish poet:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Ah, nowhere is the rose so red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Nowhere so small the thorn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nowhere so soft the downy bed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As those where we were born."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Above the patter of the rain came the sound
of approaching carriage wheels. Fru Ingemann
paused.</p>

<p>"Quick, Karen,&mdash;the bell! It may be
Uncle Thor!"</p>

<p>And so it proved! All the eight, long, lonesome
years since she had last seen this dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
brother, years in which she had lost her husband,
were quickly forgotten in his great hearty
embrace.</p>

<p>"<i>Min kaere Soster!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Min kaere Broder!</i>"</p>

<p>Their hearts were so full they could not find
words.</p>

<p>Karen, tiptoeing, wanted to fling her tiny
arms about her big, yellow-bearded, Viking-like,
Uncle Thor's neck, so he lifted the little maid
high in his strong arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Ah, Karen, <i>min lille skat!</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> How you have
grown!" he said affectionately. Soft yellow
curls framed her pretty face, and two heavy
braids of the same glorious hair hung far down
her back. "Why, you were just a little, two-year-old
baby when I went away to Rome, and
now, I've no doubt, you are dreaming of a
boarding-school off in France or Switzerland
one of these days!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>But Karen only shook her little blond head
and laughed, while Uncle Thor's beauty-loving
eye beamed on the dainty little damsel in white
embroidered frock, half-hose and slippers, as
he settled himself comfortably in the big arm-chair
near the great, green-tiled stove, whose
top almost touched the living-room ceiling.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, dear brother," said Fru
Ingemann. "Why didn't you write us all about
the great honor you have brought to the family?
I saw in this morning's 'Nationaltidende,'
that you have just been appointed Court
Painter to His Majesty, the King! It is the
greatest honor that can come to a Danish artist.
I am so proud of you!"</p>

<p>"It is true," he acknowledged, briefly, "but
tell me, sister Else, how are the boys, Aage and
Valdemar?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Aage is now a big boy of sixteen, off
doing his eight years of compulsory military
service in the army. Aage will grow up with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
straighter back and a better trained body because
of his soldiering days. He will be home
for Christmas with us."</p>

<p>"And Valdemar?"</p>

<p>"Valdemar is only thirteen, but he is in his
second year at the Metropolitan School, one of
the best State Latin Schools in all Denmark.
He will be back home at three o'clock. I could
hardly get him to consent to go to school at all,
this morning, after he was told that his Gudfar
Thor was coming."</p>

<p>"And Karen studies with her private tutors,
here, at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Thorvald, besides learning to be a
good little housekeeper, as well. But you must
be both hungry and tired. It is nearly twelve
o'clock. Come, Karen, help me spread the
table with something good for <i>Frokost</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> for
Uncle Thor."</p>

<p>A cloth of snowy damask was quickly spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
with various viands and meats; tongue, salad,
salmon, anchovies, plates of butter, with trays
containing French (white) bread, and other
trays full of thin slices of rye bread, which
is such a favorite with all Danes. Fru Ingemann
then placed a bottle of beer beside Hr.
Svensen's plate, and brought in the steaming
hot tea, which she herself poured into the
delicate cups of that wonderful crystalline ware,
the famous Royal Copenhagen porcelain&mdash;a
set doubly cherished by her as an heirloom in
her family for many generations.</p>

<p>Karen, who could herself make delicious tea,
loved to gaze at the fascinatingly delicate decoration
of the cups, which looked, as she said,
"like frost on the window-pane;" but she
never was allowed to touch this precious set of
old Royal Copenhagen, of which not one piece
had yet been broken.</p>

<p>"And <i>smörrebröd</i>, brother?" politely urged
Fru Ingemann, for no good Danish housewife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
would ever think of inviting any one to
breakfast without having <i>smörrebröd</i> on the
table.</p>

<p>"Thanks, sister Else," replied the hungry
artist, who immediately set about thickly
spreading butter&mdash;famous Danish butter&mdash;over
a slice of rye bread, as did also Karen
and her mother, after which each proceeded to
select the particular kind of fish or meat preferred,
and, arranging it upon the slice of buttered
bread, ate it much as we would a sandwich.
Uncle Thor made an especially delicious
one for Karen, who had already become a great
favorite with him.</p>

<p><i>Frokost</i> over, Fru Ingemann arose, and,
bowing slightly to her brother, said: "<i>Velbekomme!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
And Hr. Svensen did the
same.</p>

<p>"<i>Tak for Mad, Moder</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> said Karen courtesying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
first to her mother and then to her Uncle
Thor, and kissing them both&mdash;a beautiful old
Danish custom.</p>

<p>Uncle Thor was a great lover of flowers.
To-day there were beautiful flowers on the
table, in the windows, everywhere! In fact,
the whole Ingemann apartment seemed overwhelmed
with the loveliness of them. Besides
the vases, there were little flower-pots galore,
all decked in brightly-colored paper, some containing
blooming plants, others, little growing
trees.</p>

<p>"Ah, Karen, has there been a birthday
here?" asked Uncle Thor, in mock surprise.
"Run out in the hall and see what came all the
way from Naples, Italy, to Frederiksberg-Alle,
in Copenhagen, for a good little girl with long
pigtails."</p>

<p>Karen came running back with a tiny white
kid box in her hand. Opening it, she beheld
the most beautiful set imaginable of pale pink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
corals. She just couldn't wait to put the necklace
on before hugging her dear old Uncle
Thor, who himself had to fasten the pretty
chain around her slender little neck for
her.</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Thor, we had a splendid time,
and mother gave us chocolate, tea and cakes,
and this is what all the boys and girls at my
party yesterday sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'London Bridge is broken down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Gold is won and bright renown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Shields resounding, war-horns sounding,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Hild is shouting in the din,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Arrows singing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Mailcoats ringing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Odin makes our Olaf win.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Karen had hardly finished singing her song
describing the days of old, when there had been
a mighty encounter on London Bridge between
the Danes and King Olaf the Saint, ending in
the burning of the bridge, when there came a
sudden great clatter and uproar on the stairs,
with the loud barking of a dog, and the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of a boy's heavy boots, and Valdemar burst into
the room.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 311px;">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" width="311" height="500" alt="boy coming through door" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">"Valdemar burst into the room"</span></div>
</div>

<p>"Oh, my dear, dear Gudfar Thor!" he exclaimed,
throwing his arms tight round his
uncle's neck.</p>

<p>"Why, Valdemar, you are the very image of
your father!" exclaimed Hr. Svensen. "Don't
you think so, sister Else?" he questioned, as
he gazed admiringly at the sturdy, big frame,
rumpled flaxen hair, and the merry twinkle
in the honest blue Danish eyes of his godson.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Thorvald, Valdemar certainly is
the image of his father. The King thinks so,
too," agreed Fru Ingemann.</p>

<p>"King Frederik? Why, how is that, sister?
Has the king never forgotten Valdemar?"
questioned Hr. Svensen in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, Thorvald, you know the King's wonderful
memory. It never fails him. And you
must remember the great friendship that always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
existed between my dear husband and King
Frederik, from the days when, as boys together,
they went through the Military College;
and later both were recruits in the same regiment,
and had to do sentry duty, turn about,
outside his grandfather's palace. Only the
other day, Valdemar came bounding into the
house, overjoyed, to tell me that he had just
passed their Majesties, King Frederik and
Queen Lowisa, out walking on the <i>Langelinie</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
entirely unattended, and that, when he doffed
his cap to the King, his Majesty immediately
returned his salute, with a friendly smile!"</p>

<p>"But, sister Else, how do you <i>know</i> that
King Frederik thinks Valdemar the image of
his father? I don't understand," persisted Hr.
Svensen, perplexed.</p>

<p>"We know!" Fru Ingemann spoke softly
as she.</p>

<p>"Valdemar was only a little child when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
father died," she continued. "His father had
always taught Valdemar to love the King, and
he does so with all his boyish little heart. An
accident, a broken arm, soon afterwards put
the child in the Queen Lowisa Children's Hospital,
where, as you know, King Frederik makes
a monthly visit to cheer the little sufferers. The
King loves children. They say that not one
little baby-face ever escapes him, and that he
even notes each child's improvement from time
to time.</p>

<p>"Valdemar, in his little cot near the door,
heard the nurses saying: 'The King comes to-day!'</p>

<p>"His little mind was all expectation. Finally,
the King arrived. Valdemar was the first little
patient to see him enter, silk hat in his hand
as usual. Sick as he was, the boy drew himself
quickly from out of the covers, stood up in the
middle of his bed, and saluted his King with
a low bow, so low that his forehead almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
touched his pillow. The King paused in surprise
at Valdemar's cot and spoke:</p>

<p>"'My child, why do you do that? Why do
you salute me?'</p>

<p>"'Because I like you! You are the
King!'</p>

<p>"They say that the King looked into the
child's face a moment, drew his hand to his
eyes, lost in thought, then, turning quickly to
Prince Christian, who accompanied him, exclaimed
with a smile:</p>

<p>"'<i>Du ligner din Fader! Oh, vilde jeg onske
at din Fader levede! Gid Legligheden maa
komme til at hjälpe denne opvagte Dreng, for
min käre gamle Ven Ingemann's Skyld!</i>'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"Then, placing his hand on the child's
golden locks, he spoke tenderly: 'Yes, little
Valdemar Ingemann, I am the King. Always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
remember that your father and I were great
friends,' and he passed on.</p>

<p>"Valdemar has never forgotten that moment.
He never will. You and the King are
the two great heroes of the world in his eyes."</p>

<p>"Where is he now? Come, Valdemar!
Tell me all about what you like most to read,"
called Uncle Thor.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Thor, I love to read in the old
Sagas and Chronicles all about the mighty sea-fights
of the Vikings, and about the glorious
battles of the Valdemars, in the books that
Aage left me. They make me want to be a
soldier. Then I love to read everything about
Linnæus, who loved the trees and the flowers
and the whole outdoors just as I do. But, best
of all, I'd rather become a famous sculptor like
my Godfather Thor! I'd like that better than
anything else in all the world! See, Uncle
Thor, I've modelled some little things already.
Here is one,&mdash;my Great Dane, Frederik,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
here is a stork, and here is a little Viking
ship. They're not very good, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>min lille Billedhugger!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> interrupted
Hr. Svensen, with feeling, as he took the little
toy animals from Valdemar to examine them.
"This is not half bad work. But <i>what</i> have
you done them in, my boy?"</p>

<p>"In pie-paste!" laughed his mother. "I
have to hide the pie-paste when I'm baking,
to keep Valdemar from slipping it off to use
for modelling!"</p>

<p>"Valdemar, you shall have some modelling
clay. Thorvaldsen once made the Lion of Lucerne
in butter. I must tell you that story some
day," said Hr. Svensen, as he patted his little
nephew's head affectionately.</p>

<p>There was a sharp ring at the bell.</p>

<p>Karen flew to the door, then back to her
mother, excitedly exclaiming: "A box and a
letter for you, mother!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>Fru Ingemann tore the note open and read:
"Will be expelled if it occurs again!" The
words swam before her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Valdemar, my son, come explain all
this to me at once! It is from your Latin
teacher. Surely there is some mistake. It is
not like my boy!"</p>

<p>Meantime Karen had opened the box, and
displayed a most laughable clay caricature of
Valdemar's Latin teacher, with the word
"TEACHER" scratched underneath in large
letters. She burst out giggling. Even Uncle
Thor's look of mock horror soon gave way
before the cleverly done effigy, and he laughed.
He had been a boy once himself, and it <i>was</i>
funny.</p>

<p>"Well, that's exactly the way teacher
looks!" vehemently protested Valdemar in self-justification.
"Indeed he does. Ask Hendrik
or any of the boys. None of us like him one
bit, and at recess to-day Hendrik drew chalk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
cartoons of teacher all over the blackboard,
and said: 'Oh, Valdemar, you'd never dare do
it in clay!'</p>

<p>"'Yes, I <i>would</i> dare do it in clay!' I answered
him, and then, mother,&mdash;I did it. But
I didn't mean Hr. Professor Christiansen to see
it. I'm glad school's over for all summer on
Friday!"</p>

<p>Even Valdemar's mother had to laugh, as
Uncle Thor took the offending statuette in his
hand to give it a closer examination, for it was
as irresistibly funny as it was clever.</p>

<p>"Brilliant, Valdemar!" he exclaimed.
"Your work has merit. Work hard enough,
my boy, and you may become a great artist,
some day. You have the talent. Come over
to my studio to-morrow morning. I'll help you
a little with your modelling, and then, after
luncheon with me, I will take you through the
Thorvaldsen Museum. Would you like that?
And, by the way, I think there is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
nice for you in my trunk. Now I am due at
the Royal Palace. I must go and pay my respects
to the King. He will be expecting me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Thor, I'll be there!" called out
Valdemar. "Good-bye, Uncle Thor, good-bye!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>COPENHAGEN</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Summer</span> bursts suddenly in Copenhagen.
First, winter, with its deep snows, its fogs and
frosts and thaws; then a few days of showers
and a few of sunshine, <i>Blinkeveir</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the Danes
call this showery weather; and then, all at once,
the bare trees throw out their tender green
foliage and the spring flowers burst into life!
The long cold winter is over. Even then, there
sometimes come dense sea-mists which envelop
Denmark's capital, and only vanish with the
sun's warm rays. So Copenhageners have a
popular weather saying:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Monday's weather till mid-day is the week's weather till Friday,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Friday's weather is Sunday's weather,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Saturday has its own weather."</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>Saturday's weather fortunately proved ideal,
a rare June day. Copenhagen's beautiful Public
Gardens and Parks were all aglow with fragrant,
blossoming spring flowers. Valdemar's
school was at last over.</p>

<p>"Now to the woods!" he cried in joy.
"And, mother dear, can't we keep Cousin Karl
all summer with us up at our country place on
the <i>Strandvej</i>,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> while Uncle Oscar has to be
away in Jutland attending to that Park of his?
But I should like to be there with him when they
have their big American Fourth of July celebration,
and see them raise their great Star Spangled
Banner over our beloved flag! Wouldn't you,
Karl? I've heard about the American 'Fourth,'
with the Stars and Stripes waving everywhere,
and of the army man&oelig;uvres and big times they
have over there in the States on that historic
day! But Denmark's never had anything like
it before, has she, Uncle Thor?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>They were in Fru Ingemann's pretty dining-room
having their twelve o'clock little <i>frokost</i>
of tea and <i>smörrebröd</i>, this happy little party
of six, for the American relatives had arrived.</p>

<p>Early that morning, Valdemar and his Uncle
Thor had hurried to the dock to meet the
steamer, "and, but for Uncle Oscar's waving
handkerchief, and his good memory for faces,
we might have missed them entirely," explained
Valdemar, who was delighted with this first
acquaintance with his new American cousin.</p>

<p>With the first warm spring day, half of
Copenhagen whitewashes her town house windows
against the sun's hot rays, and prepares
to migrate farther north, to the famous
<i>Strandvej</i>, where soft breezes from the blue
Sound play all day over the broad sandy beach,
and rustle through the leaves of the beech-trees
in the Deer Park near by. Rich and poor alike
own their own villas, country houses or little
cottages, as the case may be, and these thickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
dot the beautiful east Sound Shore all the way
from Copenhagen to Elsinore, for great is the
Dane's love of <i>at ligger på Landet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Like all the rest, through wise and careful
planning, Fru Ingemann had her little country
place on the beautiful east Shore, where each
summer Karen and Valdemar took long walks
through the glorious beech-woods, went swimming,
boating and bathing, made their own
flower-gardens and dug in the ground to their
hearts' content. By the end of each short,
happy summer, they were both as tanned and
brown as the baskets of beech-nuts they gathered
and brought back with them for the winter.</p>

<p>"We will have great times, if only Cousin
Karl can come up for the summer with us!"
begged little Karen.</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," was the only promise
they could get out of Uncle Oscar for the moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
"I'm sure Karl would like it, but I'm
not ready to decide anything just now."</p>

<p>"If I'm not mistaken, the first thing Karl
wants is to see some of the sights of Copenhagen,"
said Hr. Svensen, as they were leaving
the breakfast table. "Suppose we all go together
and give him a bird's-eye view of Copenhagen
and the Harbor from the top of the
Round Tower! How's that, Karl?"</p>

<p>"Great! Can't we start right away?" said
the little American, for Karl was a typical little
Chicago boy, eager-minded and anxious to take
in everything at once.</p>

<p>"And the Thorvaldsen Museum, Uncle
Thor? Can't we go back there again to-day?"
urged Valdemar, for the wondrous beauty of
Thorvaldsen's masterpieces still filled all his
thoughts. On the way home from the Museum,
the previous day, he had listened to fascinating
stories told him by his godfather, stories about
the "Lion of Lucerne," and about the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
peasant boy who loved art, and worked hard,
and finally became one of the world's greatest
sculptors. Valdemar couldn't forget Thorvaldsen's
lovely "Guardian Angel," or his
wonderful figure of "Christ," with its bowed
head and arms outstretched in benediction, or
the heavenly beauty of his "Angel of the Baptism
kneeling at Christ's feet." Never, thought
Valdemar, had he seen anything half so beautiful
in all his life! Then, there were mighty
gods and heroes, and graceful nymphs. "And
only think," continued Valdemar, "when Thorvaldsen
was just a little boy eleven years old,&mdash;three
years less than I am&mdash;he so loved his
drawing and modelling that his father, who
was a poor Icelandic ship-builder and carver of
figureheads, placed him in school at the Academy
of Arts, where he won prize after prize,
not stopping until he had gained even the great
gold medal, together with the travelling scholarship
which took him to Italy to study. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
he worked hard day by day, from early dawn
till dark without stopping. No wonder the
great Museum is completely filled with masterpieces
from his hand!"</p>

<p>"Valdemar, my boy, you, too, shall enter as
a student at the Academy next fall, if your work
during the summer continues to show the talent
and improvement that will justify my sending
you. But that means you must work hard. I
leave next week for my summer studio up at
Skagen, but, until I go, you shall have a lesson
each day, if you like, and more lessons up there
all summer long, if you will come, for there
is no little boy in all the world I would rather
help than you, my Valdemar."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Thor!" cried Valdemar, throwing
his arms around his godfather's neck, wild
with joy. "I will begin to-morrow. And do
you really mean that I am to study at the Academy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my little artist," answered Hr. Svensen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
"And now let us start at once and see
some of Copenhagen's sights."</p>

<p>"And will Fru Oberstinde not accompany
us?" politely inquired Mr. Hoffman, of his
sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Danish wives and widows are given the same
titles their husbands bear, so that Fru Ingemann,
who was the widow of a Colonel, or
"Oberst," in the King's army, was often
addressed as "Oberstinde," or "Coloneless."</p>

<p>"Not to-day, thank you. Karen and I will
wait for you at home," said Fru Ingemann,
smiling as she observed the big book in her
child's hands. "You see what Karen is reading,
Hans Christian Andersen's fascinating
'<i>Billedbog unden Billeder</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Be sure to be
back in time for dinner," she called as the party
set off.</p>

<p>"<i>God Dag</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> said the tram conductor politely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as they entered. Karl smiled. Then he
began to ask questions, for he had never crossed
the ocean before, and never before had he seen
any city like Copenhagen. Chicago certainly
had its broad avenues, parks and boulevards,
great skyscrapers and fine buildings; but Chicago
had never dreamed of permitting its one
great canal to run right up through the city
streets, among the office buildings and houses,
with all its shipping, launches and water-craft,
as the Copenhagen canals all seemed to do in
the friendliest possible fashion.</p>

<p>"Copenhagen must look much more like
Amsterdam than like Athens, father. I can't
see why it is called the 'Athens of the North.'
I don't see any Greek-looking buildings here,"
protested Karl.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Karl's father, who had once
lived in Denmark long years ago. "Copenhagen
may look much more like Amsterdam,
Karl; but, while you will not see Greek buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
here, nevertheless the title of 'Athens'
comes justly, not only because of Copenhagen's
charming position on the borders of the Sound
at the entrance to the Baltic, giving the city a
great advantage commercially, and because of
its beautifully wooded environs, but particularly
on account of its splendid libraries, art
galleries, museums and great university and
schools, which rank among the best to be found
anywhere in Europe. Before we reach the
Round Tower we will doubtless get a view of
some of these."</p>

<p>"<i>Fa' vel</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> said the tram conductor, bowing
pleasantly to them as they got off at their destination.</p>

<p>Karl laughed outright. "Dear me! In Chicago
car conductors are given prizes for politeness,
but I must say, none of them have ever
yet reached the point of saying 'farewell' to
you as you leave. I'm glad they don't. Gee!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
We'd never get anywhere in Chicago if we
stopped for all that."</p>

<p>"Half of Copenhagen seems to be out on the
streets to-day," remarked Mr. Hoffman, who
had not been back to Denmark's beautiful
capital for so long that he had forgotten
what a large city it was. "Look, I believe
that must be the New Picture Gallery,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You are right," replied Hr. Svensen.
"Half the charm of Copenhagen must be traced
to her museums and rich art treasures. Shall
we give the boys a peep inside?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" exclaimed both boys at once, for
Karl had pleasant memories of Saturday afternoons
he had spent studying all the fine exhibits
in the Museum of the Art Institute of Chicago.
They had soon climbed the broad granite steps,
and were walking through the long corridors
and halls filled with great paintings, each bearing
the artist's name on the frame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"The New Picture Gallery affords a good
opportunity for studying Danish pictorial art,
just as the New Glyptothek does for studying
Danish sculpture," said Hr. Svensen, as they
were leaving.</p>

<p>"What canal is that?" asked Karl. "It
certainly is a pretty one, with that beautiful
promenade and park along one side."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is Holmen's Canal, one of the
finest in Copenhagen," answered Hr. Svensen.
It was full of ships and other water-craft.
"And that marble building which looks like an
Etruscan tomb is the Thorvaldsen Museum,
one of the principal attractions of Copenhagen.
We shall have to take another day for that.
But, just to please Valdemar, we will spend a
moment inside the church where Thorvaldsen's
'Christ,' the 'Angel of the Baptism' and 'The
Twelve Apostles' are all standing in the places
for which they were designed."</p>

<p>"The Danes have accomplished much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in sculpture than in painting, haven't they,
Uncle Thor?" Valdemar asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are quite right, Valdemar. Denmark,
as yet, has produced no painter to compare
with Thorvaldsen."</p>

<p>They paused a moment at the <i>New Raadhus-plads</i>,
with its castellated roof, and paved
semicircle in front, and again, near by, at the
New City Hall.</p>

<p>"What an attractive part of Copenhagen
this is," remarked Karl, as he observed the
many broad, fine, well-kept <i>Pladser</i>,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> with their
electric cars gliding noiselessly back and forth
with American celerity. "Copenhagen seems
to me a much cleaner, prettier city than Chicago,
father. Don't you think so? But where
are its beggars? We've not yet seen one."</p>

<p>Hr. Svensen was quick to answer that they
were not likely to see one. That Copenhagen,
with a population of nearly five hundred thousand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
has a pauper element of less than three
per cent. "For the Danes are naturally a
thrifty, industrious people, more than half of
whom are farmers, and many also go to sea in
ships," explained Hr. Svensen.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/i051.jpg" width="336" height="500" alt="women by produce" />
<div class="caption">"<span class="smcap">Where jolly-looking women with quaint headdresses were selling their wares</span>"</div>
</div>

<p>They took a tram down Stormgade over a
bridge to the island of Slotsholmen, with its
famous Fruit and Flower Market, where jolly-looking
women with quaint headdresses were
selling their wares; then over another bridge
into <i>Kongens Nytorv</i>, the King's New Market.</p>

<p>"Here we are in a different world from that
which we just left," said Hr. Svensen. They
had reached a large Square, a great centre of
life and bustle, from which thirteen busy streets
radiated. Through the trees in the centre of
this great open space the statue of a king was
seen, and red omnibuses crept slowly along on
each side of the tram line. Here they saw the
Royal Theatre, the famous Tivoli Gardens,
and the beautiful old Palace of Charlottenburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
close to an inlet of the sea, which reached right
into the Square with all its shipping, so that
masts and sails and shops and buildings took
on the same friendly aspect that they have in
Holland.</p>

<p>"But I don't see any 'skyscrapers,' Uncle
Thor, like we have in Chicago, sometimes
twenty stories high! Where are they?" inquired
the little American.</p>

<p>"In a moment or so, Karl, I will show you
two 'skyscrapers' that will amuse you!" said
Hr. Svensen. "But, look! here is a lively
scene for us first."</p>

<p>They were passing the Copenhagen fish-market,
or <i>Gammelstrand</i>, as it is called, where
the fish are sold alive, after having been kept
in large perforated boxes in the canal.</p>

<p>"Now look, Karl! how's that for a skyscraper?"</p>

<p>They were looking at the tall tower of the
<i>Bors</i>, or Exchange, one hundred and fifty feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
high, with its upper part formed by four great
dragons whose tails were so intertwined and
twisted together, high up in the air, that they
gradually tapered to a point, like a spire against
the sky.</p>

<p>Then there was another tower which interested
Karl. It was on the Church of Our Redeemer.
Circled by a long spiral stairway of
three hundred and ninety-seven steps of gleaming
brass, which wound round and round and
up and up to the very top of the sharp cone,
this tower gave the persevering climber a good
panoramic view over Copenhagen.</p>

<p>"But not so good a view as we can get from
the top of the Round Tower," said Hr. Svensen.
"Here we are now."</p>

<p>They were glad to quit the jostling crowds
on the streets,&mdash;throngs of busy shoppers,
students in cap and gown, sightseers, and, to-day,
bright-coated soldiers at every turn. The
soldiers were arriving in Copenhagen by hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
every day now, they were told, in order
to be ready, Monday morning, to welcome King
Haakon of Norway, who was expected to arrive
by ship.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Thor, will you or Uncle Oscar
not bring us down to the city, Monday, and
let us see King Haakon drive past?" cried out
both boys at once.</p>

<p>"Yes, boys," said Mr. Hoffman, "I will be
glad to bring you. I leave for Jutland in the
afternoon, Monday, and that will give me my
last chance to see a little more of Copenhagen."</p>

<p>At last they were in the Round Tower, and
felt themselves slowly ascending. Up and up,
and round and round and round on an inclined
plane, they went&mdash;past curious niches in the
wall, containing ancient monuments covered
with Runic inscriptions; past a door leading
to the university library, with its valuable collection
of rare Icelandic manuscripts; slowly,
on and on, until finally they reached the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
top with its observatory, once the home of the
great astronomer, Tycho Brahe.</p>

<p>"Peter the Great once drove a coach and
four to the top of this very same tower," volunteered
Karl. "I've read all about that at
school in Chicago. What a splendid view of
the city we are having. It is all spires, and
red roofs and gables built stairway fashion,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"And how beautiful and sparkling the
waters of the harbor look, all alive with ships,
great and small," said Valdemar. "It certainly
is a splendid seaport!"</p>

<p>Far away, the Baltic, blue as the Bay of
Naples, shimmered in the bright sunlight; and
close at hand, at the various wharves, merchantmen,
with valuable cargoes from far countries,
were loading and unloading. It was a scene of
busy life. The boys counted the flags of many
different nations. No wonder the city had been
named Merchant's Haven, or <i>Kjöbenhavn</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a good view of the coast of Sweden
we get up here," said Valdemar. "And north
of us lies Elsinore, the scene of Hamlet's tragedy.
And, Karl, I'm sure that, on a clearer
day, we could see Rugen, the German island,
where, one day long ago, the Kaiser sat on the
top of the cliff four hundred feet high, and
watched the famous sea-fight between the
Swedes and the Danes. But I don't like to talk
about Germany. I'm glad that Aage is a soldier.
Some day he will help us get Schleswig
back again!" said patriotic little Valdemar.
"And, only think, some of the geography
books have even dared to call the North Sea
the German Ocean! Kiel Harbor, now bristling
with German war-ships, once belonged to
Denmark, and so did the whole Baltic!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and once the Danes were ruling half
of England, Ireland, and Scotland, and they
even gained a foothold in Normandy," said
little Cousin Karl by way of consolation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the Germans once stood in terror of
our great Vikings, who lorded it over the seas
in every direction!" added Valdemar, with
growing enthusiasm. "Their graves may be
seen on both sides of the North Sea to-day.
And wasn't it here, Uncle Thor, when an unusually
severe winter had bridged the Baltic,
that the Swedish king, Karl Gustav, led his
army, horse, foot and guns, over the frozen
seas where no one had dared to cross before,
and finally took Copenhagen? But Denmark
and Sweden are at peace now."</p>

<p>"I'm glad that they are," replied Karl,
"and that Norway and Denmark are, too, or
we might not see King Haakon next Monday!"</p>

<p>"Come!" said Uncle Thor. "Let us hurry
home now, before we are late to dinner. It is
a wonderful old tower, having survived both
fires and bombardments. Once Copenhagen
was fortified with a wall and a moat, for Denmark's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
capital has passed through many vicissitudes,
but in these peaceful days they both have
been turned into parks for the people."</p>

<p>Dinner had been awaiting the hungry sightseers
for some time when they reached home.</p>

<p>When they had all gathered about the dinner
table, it was plain that there was some great
secret in the air. Fru Ingemann's face wore
a bright smile, in spite of the late dinner, and
little Karen held herself with an air of supreme
importance, her cheeks bright, and her blue
eyes dancing with suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>"Great news, Brother Thorvald!" began
Fru Ingemann, handing him a great white envelope
bearing the arms of His Majesty, King
Frederik. "When Karen and I were quietly
studying the recipe book, and thinking of the
dinner far more than of kings, the bell rang
sharply, and, lo and behold! there stood the
King's royal <i>Jaeger</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;in green uniform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
three-cornered hat and all&mdash;inquiring for you,
brother!</p>

<p>"'His Majesty, the King, sends this message
to Hr. Professor Svensen,' he said with
a gracious bow, and, again bowing low, departed.
Karen and I, as you can well imagine,
have been guessing everything possible and impossible
ever since, and given up in despair,
waiting for you to explain it all to us yourself,
Thorvald."</p>

<p>By this time, Valdemar's and Karen's eyes
were bulging wild with curiosity, and even Mr.
Hoffman's face showed extreme interest. What
could it be?</p>

<p>"I am summoned to the Royal Palace Tuesday
at eleven o'clock," explained Hr. Svensen,
"to begin immediate work upon a statue of
His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince Olaf
of Norway, who has graciously consented to
give me a few sittings during his short visit
in Denmark."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>When Uncle Thor had finished reading, he
passed the great white envelope, headed "Royal
Palace," with its interesting contents, over to
his sister and the children. Never before had
the King's <i>Jaeger</i> come to Fru Ingemann's little
apartment out on Frederiksberg-Alle!</p>

<p>Valdemar was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Thor! I wonder if dear little
Prince Olaf will pose with his beautiful big
dog! He is never without him, you know.
And oh, <i>dear!</i> Uncle Thor, can't you take me
along with you to mix your clay&mdash;keep it
damp for you, and just do lots of things you'd
like done? I want to go with you so much,
Uncle Thor, to watch you work! I know I
could help you ever so much, if <i>only</i> you would
just take me!" urged the little embryo sculptor
of the now great one.</p>

<p>"My dear little Valdemar," said Uncle
Thor with much tenderness in his voice, "you
are very welcome to go with me to the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Palace 'to watch me work.' But, first, I want
to watch <i>you</i> work. Watching me will not do
you much good, my little artist, until <i>you</i> have
done more work, yourself! This summons may
delay my leaving for my summer studio, up at
Skagen, until the end of the week, and I am
willing to give half of every day, until I go,
to teaching you. Now try to have some work
ready to show me by to-morrow. I will bring
you more modelling clay when you have used
up what you have here. In fact, I will bring
you some of my own tools, and some casts for
you to use as studies. Perhaps I can fit up a
real little studio right here in your own home
for you. I want to see what talent you have,
Valdemar."</p>

<p>"Oh, brother, how very good of you!" exclaimed
Fru Ingemann. "Valdemar must work
very hard. He has talent, I feel sure."</p>

<p>They had all finished their soup, a kind of
very sweet gruel with vegetables, and a dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of ham was then placed before Fru Ingemann,
who carved it, and passed around the slices,
beginning with her nearest guest. Fish, preserves,
and stewed fruits were served with it.
Then followed <i>Rod-grod</i>, a kind of jelly to
which the juice of different fruits had been
added, tea and coffee, and the little dinner
ended with the same ceremony as breakfast.
Karl tried to suppress a smile as Valdemar and
little Karen courtesied to their mother and
uncles, as they said politely: "Thank you for
the food," and went around and kissed them.</p>

<p>"My son," said Karl's father, reprovingly,
"I like these beautiful old Danish customs. I
only wish you and all our little American boys
and girls had more of this feeling of gratitude."</p>

<p>"Come, Karl," called Valdemar, "and see
my beautiful Della Robbia 'Singing Boys,' that
Uncle Thor brought to me all the way from
Italy!"</p>

<p>As the boys disappeared, the two men withdrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to the smoking-room for a chat over their
cigars, while Fru Ingemann busied herself assembling
all the "birthday flowers" into the
front window overlooking the avenue, according
to an old-time custom in Copenhagen.
Then she tucked little Karen snugly in bed with
a great pillow propped up against her feet to
keep the drafts off, for the early June day had
grown suddenly cooler towards night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>"HURRAH FOR KING FREDERIK!"</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Valdemar</span>, tell me! What is a real king
like?" exclaimed Karl, as both boys sprang
quickly out of bed bright and early Monday
morning. "Is a real king something like a
President, only he's all gorgeous with flashing
decorations, and a sword and helmet,&mdash;like
the pictures of Napoleon and the German Emperor?"</p>

<p>"Karl, you must have been dreaming about
kings! I can't tell you whether a king is like
a President or not, for I've never seen a President,"
said Valdemar. "But I am sure of
one thing, and that is that our King isn't one
bit like the German Emperor! King Frederik
just looks like the very best king Denmark
ever had, and that is what he really is!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me, Valdemar. I forgot that
you don't love the Germans. But does King
Frederik come riding a great prancing charger
with an arched neck and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll soon enough see for yourself how
the King looks, Karl. Oh, there's Uncle Thor!
Uncle Thor, how long before we can start?"
cried Valdemar, who was himself almost as
excited over the prospect of seeing two great
kings at once, as was Karl. Valdemar had
never seen King Haakon of Norway, son of
his own dear King, and, although Karl, who
was nearly twelve years old, had seen two Presidents,
and gone once with his father to the
White House in Washington, he had never
seen a real live king in all his short life.</p>

<p>"Oh, father dear!" he cried, "when <i>can</i>
we start? There! I think I heard a bugle!
Oh, do let's go!"</p>

<p>"We will start before very long, Karl, but
not until you boys have had your tea and bread.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
And, if I'm not mistaken, I heard Valdemar's
uncle say that he was to have a good lesson
in drawing this morning. King Haakon's ship
does not arrive in Copenhagen harbor before
almost noon, so there will be plenty of time."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do want my lesson!" said Valdemar,
as they finished their cups of hot tea.
"I'm ready, Uncle Thor," he called out, as
he saw his uncle passing.</p>

<p>Valdemar was in a very happy frame of mind
this fine June morning, for his uncle had praised
his work of the day before. Valdemar had
modelled a half life-sized figure of his Great
Dane, Frederik, and, to his great surprise,
Uncle Thor had not only said that it was good,
but had told his mother that it undeniably
showed evidence of real talent. Nothing could
please Valdemar more.</p>

<p>Saturday's sightseeing had given them all a
taste for more. Fortunately, Karl had brought
his bicycle with him from Chicago, and so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
two boys followed on their wheels, while Fru
Ingemann took her brother, Mr. Hoffman, and
little Karen all in a carriage, and drove the
length of the beautiful Shore Road, called the
<i>Langelinie</i>, or Long Line,&mdash;Copenhagen's
fashionable drive, that stretches for miles along
the sea. The place was gay with Sunday
crowds,&mdash;walking, riding, wheeling, driving,&mdash;all
out enjoying the warm June sunshine, as
well as the bracing sea-breeze.</p>

<p>When they reached the quaint old Citadel,
they left the carriage and strolled about the
earthworks, viewing the monument made from
the guns of the wrecked <i>Dannebrog</i>, a ship fitly
named after the Danish flag. Promenaders
thronged the Shore Road at this point, gazing
at the shipping of all nations which here covered
the Sound, and off into the dim distance,
at the shores of Sweden.</p>

<p>Karl thought that his Aunt Else must have
hosts of little friends, for all the small boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
bowed, and the little girls courtesied so prettily,
as she passed. But Fru Ingemann explained
to him that it was only a custom of all
well-bred Danish children to bow and courtesy
to their elders, and then she told him how,
every spring at <i>Paaske</i>, or Easter, as we call
it, this beautiful Shore Road is thronged all
day long with gay crowds all decked out in
their <i>Paaske</i> finery, as it is again later at <i>Store
Bededag</i>, or Great Praying Day, on the fourth
Friday after Easter.</p>

<p>From here they drove out to the old Castle
of Rosenborg, with its fine garden where little
children were playing about the statued-form of
their beloved story-teller, Hans Christian Andersen;
and then straight home again, passing,
on their way, the royal residential quarter,
Amalienborg, which forms a great open Square,
adorned with the beautiful Marble Church,
and, in the centre of the Square, with a statue
of King Frederik V.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now we're off!" said Uncle Thor, as Valdemar
finished a very good drawing lesson, for
Karl and his father, and Karen and her mother
were already waiting.</p>

<p>At first the electric tram simply flew. But,
as they approached the down-town section of
the city, its way was often blocked by the dense
crowds, who, like themselves, were coming to
witness the arrival of Copenhagen's honored
royal guest, His Majesty, King Haakon of
Norway.</p>

<p>"Norroway-over-the-Foam, as it was once
called," laughed Fru Ingemann, "is a land of
beauty which we must all visit some day. It
is so many, many times the size of our little
Denmark that it makes us feel, by comparison
at least, a very small country indeed."</p>

<p>"But Denmark occupies more space on the
map than either Belgium or Holland," said Valdemar.</p>

<p>"And Denmark is nearly twice the size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of Massachusetts," added Karl. "But, oh!
Just do look at the terrible crowds!&mdash;and
right here is where we get off! Father says
'Come!'"</p>

<p>All at once they were thrust into the vast
crowd. All Copenhagen seemed suddenly to
have poured by thousands forth into the streets,
and the flags of Norway and Denmark floated
everywhere side by side.</p>

<p>"If only we can make the opposite side of
the street!" said Uncle Thor, nervously looking
about him in every direction, "we shall be
safe, for right up there, on the second floor of
that building, is my friend's office, from the
window of which we are to view the royal procession.
Ah! we're safe now!"</p>

<p>No sooner had they taken their positions in
the large open window, than they heard, in
the distance, a cannon's loud report. It was
followed by a salute of guns and loud
cheering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"There!" said both boys at once. "That
means that King Haakon has landed, and is
now on his way here!"</p>

<p>The cheering sounded nearer and nearer, and
the cannon continued to boom.</p>

<p>"Forty guns!" said Valdemar, who had
been counting. "Forty guns is Denmark's
royal salute. Karen dear, can you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, brother," said the child,
whose feet were fairly dancing with so much
excitement. "But look! They are clearing
the street! The people are being made to keep
back on the sidewalks. Listen! That is our
glorious old National Hymn that the splendid
Royal Guards are now playing. The King
must be near! Listen, Karl! Oh, isn't it all
thrilling!"</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer sounded the familiar
strains.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> splendid, Karen," conceded Karl, "but
I'd like the Star Spangled Banner just as well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and, besides, I guess a king's no bigger'n a
President! Oh, look!" But it was only an
advance guard of mounted police.</p>

<p>"I'm glad, mother, that our window has the
largest flag in town flying from it," said Valdemar.
"I just <i>do</i> hope the King will look
up here and see it! Listen! Now the people
are beginning to cheer right down here under
our very window! And the men are doffing
their hats!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!" cheered the
loyal thousands, as the scarlet-coated King's
Guard came in view.</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Karen, with a long-drawn
breath of delight. "Oh! isn't it glorious!
Hear the bugle! And here come the mounted
Hussars with their little red capes fastened on
one shoulder, and swords flashing! How splendidly
they ride!"</p>

<p>"Mother, I'm going to wave my own flag
when the King's carriage passes!" cried patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
little Valdemar. "If King Frederik
will only look up! Don't you hope he will,
Karl? Oh! there's his carriage now! Yes,
he sees my flag waving! He's looking!
I'm going to cheer! Hurrah for King
Frederik!"</p>

<p>The King heard and raised his head. His
eyes fell directly upon Valdemar's bright face,
as had been the case that long ago day, in the
Children's Hospital. King Frederik smiled,
bowed, and gave the lad a military salute of
recognition. King Haakon was seated beside
King Frederik, but Valdemar did not see
him. In the following carriage were the two
queens, Queen Maud of Norway, and their
own beloved Danish Queen Lowisa, with
little Crown Prince Olaf, of Norway, seated
between them; but Valdemar saw only King
Frederik.</p>

<p>"Mother! He <i>knew</i> me!" cried Valdemar,
as the brilliant procession passed slowly out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sight, and the music, whose strains came faintly
back to them, had changed from Denmark's
"Kong Christian" to the Norwegian National
Hymn in honor of King Haakon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>UP THE SOUND TO HAMLET'S CASTLE</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mother</span> dear, how fine and cool the sea-breeze
feels!" exclaimed Valdemar, as the little
Sound steamer puffed along over the bright
Baltic waves, past the big merchant-ships on
the blue Sound, making many stops on its way
up towards historic old Elsinore, the spot made
famous by Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Uncle Oscar had departed three days before,
going directly to the Jutland Park, to begin
preparations for the entertaining of the thousands
of loyal Danish-American visitors, expected
to arrive in time for the Fourth celebration,
and Fru Ingemann had given him her
promise to meet him there, with the three children,
for that great event.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>For it had not taken Fru Ingemann long to
decide that Uncle Oscar's plan for the summer
was best. Summer days are long, but few, in
Denmark,&mdash;the winters cold and stormy,&mdash;and
Karen and Valdemar needed the trip as
much as did Karl, she told herself. So the
little party of four were already on their way
north, to see for themselves all the wonders
and beauties of Jutland, of which Karl's father
had been telling them.</p>

<p>Once Fru Ingemann had decided, the days
fairly flew. Valdemar wanted to start at once.
But there was all the packing to be done&mdash;of
things to be left, and things to be taken&mdash;and
the flat to be closed for at least several
months.</p>

<p>Karen, who had never before been farther
from home than their own little villa up on the
<i>Strandvej</i>, was overjoyed and danced busily
about, saving her mother steps in a thousand
different ways; while Valdemar and Karl surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Fru Ingemann by getting out ladders,
buckets and brushes, and nicely whitewashing
all the flat windows, which was really being
very useful indeed.</p>

<p>"Aunt Else, why is our steamer so awfully
crowded with people? Are the Sound boats
always like this?" asked Karl, who could hardly
turn his chair around without knocking into
some one.</p>

<p>"Yes, Karl, it's like this every year at
'Deer-Park-time.' The huge crowds are as
eager as ourselves to leave Copenhagen with
the first warm day and flee to <i>Skoven</i>,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> for we
Danes love our beautiful woods. With the
first bursting of the beech-buds, everybody asks
everybody else: 'Have you been in the woods
yet?' And then by thousands&mdash;young and
old&mdash;they flock to our beloved beech-woods.
Those who cannot find room on the boats take
the first train, or carriage, or cycle, or car, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
even foot it&mdash;any way at all in order to reach
the Deer Park, for that is where most of them
go. After we make a stop there, we shall have
plenty of room on our boat, Karl. Look! We
are passing Charlottenlund, the Crown Prince's
palace. You can see it up among those fine old
trees."</p>

<p>"Then, Aunt Else," asked Karl, "isn't
'Deer-Park-time' something like our American
'Indian Summer,' only that it comes
in the spring? It's your finest part of
spring, and our best part of fall, when every
one wants to live out of doors. Isn't that
it?"</p>

<p>"That's just right, Karl," laughed Fru Ingemann.
"And a little Danish boy would feel
almost as badly not to be taken to the beech-woods
when 'Deer-Park-time' comes, as would
a little English boy if he got no plum pudding
on Christmas day, or a little Scotch boy without
his currant bun on New Year's Day, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
nice little American boy like you, Karl, if he
couldn't have any firecrackers for his Fourth of
July celebration. But here we are stopping at
the Deer Park now. Half the people are getting
off."</p>

<p>Valdemar's eyes looked far beyond the disembarking
crowds landing at the pier. He saw
only the dark pine trees in the distance, straight
and tall, suggesting to his imaginative mind
giant masts for Viking ships. Many a fine day
had he spent tramping through those tree-shaded
walks with his mother, while she told
him wonderful stories about Denmark's great
heroes of old.</p>

<p>"In America, we like to go to the woods,
too," said Karl; "but not just to walk and walk
all day. We like to play ball, or climb the trees
for nuts, or keep doing something all the time.
Do you ever do anything but just walk, in your
woods?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes, on a warm summer's evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in the woods, we sing some beautiful old hymn,
like Grundtwig's:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'For Danes have their home where the fair beeches grow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">By shores where forget-me-nots cluster,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">And fairest to us, by cradle and grave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">The blossoming field by the swift-flowing wave.'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>There are no people in all the world, Karl, who
have the same simple love for their trees, as
do the Danes," explained his Aunt Else.</div>

<p>"There, Karl, we are starting again," said
Valdemar.</p>

<p>The beautiful Deer Park, with its masses and
pyramids of green foliage, followed the Sound-Shore
for five miles before the steamer had left
it behind. The boat kept close to the shore,
stopping frequently at the little, red-roofed settlements,
inviting little villas and sea-bathing
resorts, to let off more passengers, for everybody
in Copenhagen who can, must lie on the
<i>Strandvej</i> for at least a part of every summer,
enjoying the out-of-doors amusements, the bathing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the woods, sea, sky and sunshine. Nestling
among the trees of the <i>Strandvej</i>, for
miles, were little white, yellow, and green villas,
among them Fru Ingemann's,&mdash;at the
sight of which Karen, who always felt a little
sick on the water, brightened, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There, Karl, is ours! You must come back
and spend another summer with us up there.
We do have the best times, don't we, Valdemar?"</p>

<p>The afternoon was singularly fine. Hundreds
of ships were gliding silently past them
in one continuous procession.</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Karl, "there must be the
flags of every nation on the globe. I've counted
the Russian, German, French, English, Swedish,
Norwegian, Italian, Greek, Spanish and
Portuguese flags, and, look!&mdash;there is a
steamer with our dear old United States flag!
How narrow the sound is growing, Aunt Else.
The mountains of Sweden look nearer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
nearer. I believe that, if I yelled loud enough,
the people over there could easily hear me."</p>

<p>"Yes, Karl, we must be nearing Helsingör,
for the Sound certainly is narrowing rapidly.
It is less than two miles wide at that point. It
hardly seems three hours since we left Copenhagen,"
remarked Fru Ingemann.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, look! Isn't that old Kronborg
now?" exclaimed Valdemar. "That is surely
Hamlet's Castle, mother! Helsingör is where
we land!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is grim old Kronborg Castle, Valdemar.
Many a tale its old gray walls could
tell of terrible fighting, royal merrymaking,
and of sadness. Karen and you, boys, shall go
all through it when we land. For three hundred
years Kronborg was the key to the Sound,
keeping a sentry-like guard over the gate between
the Baltic and the North Sea. For before
the Kiel Canal was cut, as many as twenty
thousand ships every year passed through this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
narrow strait, bound for Russian and Swedish
ports; and Denmark grew rich from the Sound
dues she collected. Now, the gates are open
to the ships of all countries, and, when foreign
sovereigns or men-of-war glide through this
narrow silvery streak dividing Sweden and Denmark,
old Kronborg's cannon give a friendly
salute. But, come, we are landing now."</p>

<p>It was but a few minutes' walk up to the
frowning old fortress on the promontory, with
its many lofty, gray stone towers rising from
the castellated roof. Karl was seeing for the
first time in all his life a real "fairy-tale" castle,
surrounded by a broad moat and ramparts.</p>

<p>First they were shown the apartments occupied
by the royal family when, at rare times,
they visit Kronborg. Passing a little chapel,
with its carved choir-stalls and pulpit, they
found themselves, after a fatiguing ascent, out
upon the flat roof of a great square tower, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
which they gazed in admiration in all directions,
for the day was remarkably clear and
bright.</p>

<p>Far and near, over land and sea, the view
was magnificent. To the east rose the mountainous
Swedish coast, and, to the north, the
gleaming blue waters of the Sound expanded
into the equally blue Kattegat. All was still,
like noon. Nothing seemed to move but the
multitude of white sails silently passing and
repassing through the narrow silvery strait
below.</p>

<p>"Mother dear, do you think I shall ever be
able to paint anything so beautiful as this?
Uncle Thor could do it justice, mother; but
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, if you work hard enough," was
his mother's only answer, as she drew his coat
collar closer about his neck, for a chill wind had
risen.</p>

<p>"The Swedish coast is so near, mother, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I can see the windows of the houses," said
Karen. "The coast doesn't look dangerous,
does it, mother; but Valdemar says the guard
told him he had seen as many as six shipwrecks
here in one night."</p>

<p>"Yes, child, there are often bad storms on
this coast; for the Kattegat is very rough and
dangerous at times. Now we must go."</p>

<p>"But Aunt Else, I want to see the famous
platform where the ghost of Hamlet's father
walked that night," protested Karl, as the little
party started down.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear boy, the ghost of Hamlet's
father is believed to have paraded this very
platform, right here where we are standing,"
laughed his aunt, as she put her arm about
little Karen, who shuddered at the thought.</p>

<p>"Don't you know the familiar verse, Karl?</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'And I knew that where I was standing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In old days long gone by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Hamlet had heard at midnight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The ominous spectre cry.'</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is, indeed, the far-famed castle of
Elsinore, of glorious Shakespeare's fancy, Karl.
You must, of course, have read about it in your
school in Chicago," said Fru Ingemann, with
a twinkle in her eye. "Through the magic
of Shakespeare's great genius this out-of-the-way
corner of our beloved little Denmark has
become forever famous the whole world over.
But come quickly, all of you; we have much
yet to see this afternoon, before we take our
steamer for Aarhus."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it here in this fortress, too, that
beautiful Queen Caroline Matilda was imprisoned
until her brother, George III, sent her to
Germany, where she soon died?" asked Valdemar,
as they hurried down.</p>

<p>"And, oh, Aunt Else, isn't it right here in
this castle that Holger Danske stays?" demanded
Karl.</p>

<p>"Yes, Valdemar, Queen Caroline Matilda
was a prisoner here; and Karl, no one can ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
see Holger Danske, although it is believed that
he is alive somewhere down in the underground
vaults of this fortress, and that, whenever Denmark
needs him, he will arise and come to her
aid. All little Danish boys know him. Valdemar,
you tell Karl the story," said Fru Ingemann,
as the little party hurried on.</p>

<p>"Well, Karl, Holger Danske is the great
national hero of Danish tradition, the founder
of the Danish nation, in fact," began Valdemar,
who was thoroughly familiar with his country's
history and traditions. "Holger Danske's cradle
was a warrior's shield, so the story goes,
and he sits down in the deep dark dungeon of
this fortress, all alone, clad in iron and steel,
his head forever resting on his strong arms,
bending over a marble table to which his great
long beard has grown fast. There he forever
slumbers and dreams that he sees and knows
everything that is happening above in his beloved
Denmark. Whenever his country is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
peril, or stands in need of his services, he will
appear. But, every Christmas night, one of
God's angels visits him in his dungeon, and
assures him that all his dreams are true, and
that Denmark is threatened with no extraordinary
danger, and that he may sleep on again."</p>

<p>As they reached the Castle grounds, the guide
pointed out the old moat, where Ophelia
drowned herself, and the spring near by that
bears her name. Then he took them to the
grave of the melancholy Dane, in a beautiful
shaded spot, marked by a moss-grown cairn of
stones, and a granite shaft bearing the inscription:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>"FAIRY-TALE" CASTLES AND PALACES</small></h2>


<p>"'<span class="smcap">Fredensborg</span>' means 'Castle of Peace.'
It is an idyllic spot near here, famous the whole
world over as the happy holiday gathering-place,
every summer, of half the present
crowned heads, majesties, and royal highnesses
of Europe," said Fru Ingemann. "Let
us take this waiting carriage now for a quick
drive over there and back again in time for
our steamer this afternoon to Aarhus. All this
part of Eastern Zealand is so rich in romantic,
fairy-tale castles and palaces, that I
only wish we had time enough to see them all.
But Fredensborg's hospitable roof has sheltered
all the royal children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren
of good old King Christian IX,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of Denmark, who was affectionately called
'The Grandfather of Europe.' Only think of
a family reunion including King Frederik VIII
and Queen Lowisa, of Denmark; their son,
King Haakon, of Norway; former Queen
Alexandra, of England, and her sister, the
Dowager Empress Dagmar, of Russia, who
were both Danish princesses; King George and
Queen Mary, of England; King George, of
Greece; and the Czar of all the Russias,&mdash;all
meeting, every summer, in a quiet little family
reunion in our obscure little Denmark at Fredensborg
Palace!"</p>

<p>"But, Aunt Else, you left out the German
Emperor!" observed Karl, who persisted in
always mentioning the Germans.</p>

<p>"The German Emperor never comes to these
royal gatherings, Karl. He is the only king
who is not welcomed on Danish soil," explained
Fru Ingemann, gently. "But here we are now
at the palace."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>They approached the palace through an avenue
of magnificent old lindens, through whose
interlaced branches they caught glimpses of the
blue sky and of the still bluer Lake Esrom, near
by. Then, entering a very stony courtyard,
the carriage stopped before a few steps, guarded
by two stone lions.</p>

<p>Soon they were walking through the apartments
of the Queen, on the right, and of those
of the King, on the left. From the King's plain
working room, on the floor above, they looked
out over the beautiful Marble Garden, so called
from the elaborate statuary romantically placed
among the old beech-trees, under whose deep
shadows King Edward and Queen Alexandra,
of England, did their courting. Nor was theirs
the only royal love tale those mighty old trees
could tell.</p>

<p>In one room still stood the historic old Settee
of the Czar, so called because the present Czar's
father, who loved children, used to sit there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and play for hours with his own royal children,
whom he loved so well.</p>

<p>Nothing interested them all more than the
inscriptions&mdash;tender and pathetic&mdash;which
they found on several of the historic old windows.
Karl could only read a few, which happened
to be in English, such as "Alexandra,
September, 1868," and another, "Willie,"
which the King of Greece had written. But,
when it came to a French inscription: "<i>Que
Dieu veille sur la Famille Royale et la protège.</i>
Alexandra, 1867," Karl had to call upon Valdemar
to translate it for him, as well, of course,
as all the Danish ones.</p>

<p>"'May God watch over the royal family
and protect it,' is the translation of the French
one, Karl, by Queen Alexandra; and Olga,
Queen of Greece, has written in Danish here
on this window: '<i>Danmark, Danmark, elskede
Hjem</i>,' which means: 'Denmark, Denmark,
beloved home,' and here is a touching one by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the late Czar: '<i>Farvel kjaere gamle Fredensborg</i>,'
'Farewell, dear old Fredensborg.'"</p>

<p>"And, mother," said Karen, "here is:
'Farewell, my beloved Fredensborg. Alexandra,
September, 1868;' and 'Christian-Louise,
1864,' and 'Valdemar-Marie, 1885.'"</p>

<p>They drove away through the royal grounds,
which reached down to the shores of beautiful
Esrom Lake, glimmering like a sapphire in the
setting sun's soft light, and were soon back once
more at Helsingör.</p>

<p>"Aunt Else," said Karl, "Fredensborg Castle
looked exactly like the pictures of castles in
the books of fairy tales."</p>

<p>"If that is what you like, Karl, then some
day you must surely see Frederiksborg Palace,
in the lovely forest region north of Copenhagen.
It stands on an island in a lake, and
is all spires, turrets and battlements, and certainly
looks like a real fairy-tale castle," said
Fru Ingemann. "Some of its venerable beeches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
are five hundred years old. But here is the
little inn where we must have something nice
and warm to eat before we take our steamer,
in just a few minutes, for we will be sailing all
night. We have barely time, if we hurry."</p>

<p>After finishing their little dinner of hot cinnamon-flavored
soup, broiled fish, rye bread,
preserves and <i>röd-gröd</i>, all of which tasted so
good after their drive back through the woods,
they boarded the little steamer which was to
take them on their all-night trip over the Kattegat
to Aarhus, on the east coast of the peninsula
of Jutland, or the Continent, as the Danes
call it.</p>

<p>"Aunt Else, on one of those windows at
Fredensborg, was the inscription: 'Valdemar-Marie,
1885.' Won't you tell me all about the
Valdemars? They were Denmark's greatest
kings, weren't they?" urged Karl.</p>

<p>"Yes, but Valdemar will be glad to tell you
all about them and about all the other kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of Denmark, too, Karl; but wait&mdash;here comes
Fróken Johanne Nielsen, with her little nephews,
Tykke and Hans, to talk to us. Fróken
Nielsen is a great traveller. Children, don't
you remember meeting them one summer up
on the Strandvej?"</p>

<p>Karen courtesied prettily, while the boys
arose, bowed, and politely gave their seats to
the Nielsens. Then Fru Ingemann listened
while Fróken Johanne, who only remained a
few minutes, told them of the famous sights
of Stevns Klint, or cliff, on Zealand's eastern
coast, where they had just been; and of the
still more wonderful scenery on the romantic
little island of Möen, in the Baltic, where the
dazzling white limestone cliffs of Lille and the
Store Klint adorn the sea-coast, and where the
summer-time sunset comes after nine o'clock,
and the clear northern light lasts until morning.</p>

<p>"And don't forget about Faxö, Aunt Johanne,
or Svendborg. Faxö was the best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
all," put in little Tykke, as he delved deep
down into his pockets and brought forth some
pieces of fine coral.</p>

<p>"Yes, Faxö is an ancient coral crag jutting
out into the Baltic," explained Fróken Johanne.
"It is full of beautiful and rare fossils, and
from Svendborg, on Fyen Island, we had such
a beautiful view for miles and miles. From
one high place the children could see alternate
land and water five times, as well as the coasts
of Sweden and Germany. The islands seemed
like stepping-stones in the Baltic. But come,
children, say good-bye; we must go."</p>

<p>While they had been talking the setting sun
had thrown a yellow glory over the waters in
front of Elsinore, which was now fading slowly
away. The forests about the old castle on the
promontory became dark, blurred masses, and
the white sails below were mere moving shadows.
The children could no longer see even
the many fine specimens of fossils and coral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
which Hans and Tykke had generously divided
with them.</p>

<p>The little steamer advanced upon the rolling
<i>Kattegat</i>, with great flocks of white-winged sea-gulls
following in its wake. Fru Ingemann noticed
that Karen, who never could stand the
churning motion of a boat, was turning perceptibly
pale, and that a vague, uncertain feeling
seemed to be creeping over even Valdemar and
Karl, so she took her sleepy little brood below
and soon had them all tucked snugly into bed
for the night.</p>

<small>THE LEGEND OF THE SACRED "DANNEBROG"</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">It's</span> a letter from Uncle Oscar, mother!
I just know it is!" cried Valdemar, as Fru Ingemann
opened and commenced reading aloud
the only letter found awaiting them the next
day, upon their arrival in the ancient town of
Aarhus.</p>

<p>"And best of all," concluded the letter, "I
have a great surprise in store for you all when
you reach the Park next week. Karl will be
especially delighted."</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Else, what can it be? How I
wish I knew what father means!" exclaimed
Karl, dancing about the room in anticipation of
so soon seeing his father again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us make plans quickly," said Fru Ingemann.
"I am wondering how we shall ever
crowd into one short week all the fine trips and
excursions we shall want to take before we leave
here, for Fru Petersen tells me that the surrounding
country is far more interesting than
Aarhus itself."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, the Riis Skov and the Marselisborg
Skov, on the outskirts of Aarhus, are
at their very best now for picnicking," added
Valdemar, who always loved the woods. "A
farmer passed us on our wheels this morning,
and told us so."</p>

<p>"And he said we should not fail to visit the
beautiful chains of lakes and fir-forests around
Silkeborg," put in Karl. "He told us that
Silkeborg was once just a manor, the property
of the bishops of Aarhus; and that it came to
be built in such a funny way. He said that one
of the bishops was so charmed with the scenery
in that part of the country that he took a vow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that he would build a house wherever his silk
cap, which a gust of wind had blown away,
should remain. And so the strange name came
about. Isn't that a funny story, Karen? Can't
we go over to Silkeborg right now, Aunt
Else?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not to-day, Karl, for it's much too late.
Besides, the sky looks threatening. I thought
I heard something like low, distant thunder just
a moment ago. But to-morrow we can take
an all-day trip over to Mt. Himmelbjaerg and
back, if we're all up bright and early in the
morning," said Fru Ingemann.</p>

<p>They were stopping with the Petersen family,
in a little red-roofed, many-gabled house
on a quiet side street in Aarhus. Karen and
her mother had taken a short walk through the
residential portion of the old town and back,
and the two boys had been out on their wheels
most of the day, eagerly exploring every nook
and cranny of the healthy little trading city on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the Kattegat, which was a town of standing in
the far-off days when Copenhagen was but a
mere little fishing village. They had ridden
past the Public Library, the artistic Custom-house,
pretty little theatre, the interesting Art
Gallery, with its fine collections by Danish
artists, the grim old red-brick Gothic Cathedral,
with its gables, narrow pointed windows and
massive tower, and finally down to the busy
harbor of Jutland's thriving capital, where large
vessels enter, for it is built out on the open
shore.</p>

<p>"Aunt Else, the other day, I remember, you
called Jutland 'the peninsula;' Fru Petersen
always says 'the Continent;' and once I heard
somebody speak of 'us Islanders;' so which is
it?" asked Karl.</p>

<p>"I'm not surprised that you are confused,
Karl. I will try to explain it all to you," said
his aunt. "Denmark is literally an Island
Kingdom, for she has about two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
islands in all, situated at the entrance of the
Baltic. Since the cutting of the Kiel Canal,
even Jutland, which originally was, and still is
in name, the Cimbrian Peninsula, has now become
in reality an island, some of whose parts,
being actually below the sea-level, are protected
by dykes and embankments. Even the
Limfjord, which is no longer a fjord but a
Sound, cuts Jutland in two again, adding one
more to the list of Denmark's many islands.
Even Copenhagen, Denmark's capital, is built
upon two islands,&mdash;the great island of Zealand
and the little island of Slotsholmen, over
which it extends.</p>

<p>"Besides these, and many other smaller
islands of the Danish archipelago, Denmark
has colonies, much larger than herself, which,
strangely enough, are all islands. One is Iceland,
with its volcanic fires and geysers spouting
through the ice; and the great snow-buried
island of Greenland is another of Denmark's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
frigid possessions. There is also a group of
islands in the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt Else, thank you for telling me
all about it. But I do wish I knew what father's
'great surprise' is to be!" sleepily murmured
Karl, closing his eyes. "Valdemar, you were
going to tell us all about Denmark's kings.
Won't you do it now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do, brother," begged Karen, as she
yawned and buried her flaxen head in a big, soft
pillow.</p>

<p>"Tell my best stories to such a sleepy audience?
I guess not!" said Valdemar, himself
yawning.</p>

<p>"Such a sleepy lot of children! Off to bed,
every one of you, and up early in the morning,"
said Fru Ingemann, kissing them good
night.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>Hardly had they been in bed an hour, when
a terrific thunder-storm broke over Aarhus.
With the first deafening crash of thunder, the
whole Petersen family sprang from their beds,
dressed and rushed to the sitting-room, where
they huddled around the great tile stove, their
arms loaded down with their most treasured
family possessions, Fru Petersen herself carrying
the family plate and the cherished recipe
book, which in Danish households is handed
down from grandmother to mother and daughter.</p>

<p>The storm passed as quickly as it had come.
By morning the ground was dry, the sky fair
and blue, and Fru Ingemann and her charges
well on their way to famous old Himmelbjaerg,
which means Heaven's Mountain, for it is the
highest spot in all Denmark.</p>

<p>"Why didn't we all jump out of our beds
last night, too, mother," questioned Karen, as
their train was passing through much low, hilly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
country, in the midst of beautiful woods and
lakes.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was just <i>noget snak</i>,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Karen. The
Petersens were brought up in the country, and
they were afraid of fire by lightning. But here
we are, Karl, in the scattered little town of
Silkeborg, where the bishop's silk cap blew."</p>

<p>They first armed themselves with a large
basket of provisions, then took a trim little
motor-boat, which carried them past woods and
gardens and picturesque little stork-inhabited
farmsteads, up a pleasant river which soon
widened into a lake, and then from one blue
lake into another, on and on, until they finally
stopped at the foot of heather-covered old
Himmelbjaerg, on whose summit they could
see a tall, obelisk-like monument.</p>

<p>"It's Denmark's Pike's Peak! Isn't it, Aunt
Else?" exclaimed Karl in delight. "Father
and I have climbed Pike's Peak in Colorado,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and, I can tell you, mountain climbing is just
lots of fun! Can't we go to the very top to-day,
Aunt Else?"</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/i109.jpg" width="336" height="500" alt="family having a picnic" />
<div class="caption">"<span class="smcap">They spread them on the grass in the shadow of the great brick tower</span>"</div>
</div>

<p>With their long alpenstocks, Karen and the
boys led the way up the gentle slope, while
Fru Ingemann closely followed with the basket
of good things to eat&mdash;<i>smörrebröd</i>, oranges,
tarts, cake and sugar-plums, which disappeared
as though by magic when they spread them on
the grass in the shadow of the great brick
tower.</p>

<p>The view from the "Kol," or top, was indescribably
beautiful, reaching as far as eye
could see over far-stretching forests, and valleys
and corn fields and chains of lakes, in every
direction to the unbroken horizon.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother! how wonderful!" exclaimed
Valdemar, after he had looked long
and silently at the impressive scene before him.
"It's like one of Turner's great paintings!"</p>


<p>The grass on the mountain-side waved in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
strong summer wind. Beetles hummed, insects
buzzed in the heather about them, and
a little field-lark, perched on a near-by beech-tree,
poured forth its song, while Karen chased
the brilliant-winged butterflies as they dashed
through the sunlight.</p>

<p>"'Erected by Frederik VII,'" read Valdemar
aloud, deciphering the inscription on the
base of the brick tower.</p>

<p>Karen and Karl came running up, their arms
full of mountain wild-flowers they had found
almost hidden among the deep heather.</p>

<p>"Valdemar, are you going to tell us all
about the Danish kings now?" urged Karl,
who was a good student of United States history,
and loved hero-tales of any country.
"Please start at the very beginning. Karen
wants to hear, too."</p>

<p>"And, after the story is finished, perhaps
we shall have time for a little row on the lake,"
added Fru Ingemann.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Quickly they ranged themselves comfortably
on the grass in the shade of one of Himmelbjaerg's
giant old beeches, whose long arms
swept the ground about them.</p>

<p>"Denmark means 'land of dark woods,'"
began Valdemar, who loved his beautiful country,
and was familiar with her legends and
history from his babyhood up. "The Northmen
were a fire-worshipping heathen people,
according to Snorre Sturlason, who says that
Odin, their chief god, was a real personage,
who used to appear to men. But all this early
history of Denmark is so full of legend, petty
fights of kings, piratical exploits, and strange,
wild stories and romances of the Skalds, that
it is very hard to tell which is fact or fable,
until we come to the last thousand years of
Danish history.</p>

<p>"But in those early mythological days, when
Denmark was covered with dark forests of
mighty firs, Dan the Famous was one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
earliest kings, reigning in 1038 <small>B. C.</small> He became
powerful, after uniting many small chieftains
to himself, and so, according to some
authorities, the country was called 'Danmark,'
or the border of the 'Dans,' or
Danes.</p>

<p>"Gorm the Old, in the middle of the ninth
century, was really the first king to rule over
the whole of Denmark, and his was called the
Golden Age. His beautiful young wife, Queen
Thyra Dannebod (the Dane's Joy), was full
of goodness and wisdom, and after Gorm's
death, she built the famous Dannewirke, a
great wall that stretched across Denmark from
the North Sea to the Baltic, for her people's
protection against the fearful inroads and plunderings
of their southern neighbors. One may
see the graves near Jellinge, to-day, of Gorm
the Old and Queen Thyra, two heather-covered,
flat-topped cairns marked by massive old
Runic stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then Gorm's son, King Harold Blaatand
(Blue-tooth), ruled over Denmark, and was
slain one night as he slept by a camp-fire, by
the gold-tipped arrow of his heathen enemy,
Planatoke. After him came his son, Svend
Tveskaeg, who commenced the conquest of
England, which was ended by Knud den Store,
or Canute the Great, thus uniting the crowns
of both kingdoms during his reign and that of
his son, Harthaknud (Hardicanute), who was
followed by King Svend Estridsen.</p>

<p>"Sometime I must tell Karl some of the
wonderful tales I've read about all these old
kings&mdash;tales re-told from the ancient Sagas
and Chronicles, with their warrior-songs, giant-songs,
hero-tales and ballads. Danish literature
is full of them.</p>

<p>"But now we come to the three great Valdemars,
and their glorious battles."</p>

<p>"And all about our <i>Dannebrog</i>&mdash;the flag
that fell from heaven, Valdemar," broke in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Karen, who never could hear that story often
enough.</p>

<p>"And tell us all about the king who was
put into a bag, won't you, Valdemar?" urged
Karl.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm coming right now to both those
stories, which happened in the reign of Valdemar
II. But first I want to say that it was
Valdemar I who cleared the Baltic and North
Seas of all the terrible Wend pirates, and it
was also during his reign that Denmark's war-like
bishop, Absalon, founded Copenhagen and
gave the people a constitution.</p>

<p>"With Valdemar II a great and glorious
era for Denmark set in. The old ballads and
folk-songs tell how he courted Dagmar, the
fair Bohemian princess, for his bride, and never
was Danish queen more beloved by her people.</p>

<p>"Indeed, the Golden Age seemed to have
returned to Denmark under the early reign of
this successful young monarch, who was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
knightly and handsome as he was courageous.
His empire grew until he finally became master
of Holstein, Schwerin, and all the provinces
of Northern Germany, and his people
called him Valdemar Seir (the Victorious).
When the Pope granted him sovereignty over
all the peoples he could convert, he set out upon
a crusade against the pagans of Esthonia, with
more than a thousand ships, and many thousands
of men. With the Pope's blessing he
sailed across the Baltic, but so vast did the host
of the enemy appear, as his fleet neared the
shore, that the Danes at first feared to land.
But their archbishop reassured them, and they
landed in safety. Towards evening, with King
Valdemar at their head, the battle raged furiously.
The struggle grew fiercer and fiercer,
until the Danes, who were outnumbered, were
beginning to give way, when there arose a
great cry: 'The Banner! The Banner!' Pagan
and Christian paused. All eyes turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
towards the sky, where, as though miraculously
flung from heaven, was seen falling into
the midst of the Christian ranks a blood-red
banner bearing a great white cross,&mdash;our
sacred <i>Dannebrog</i>. 'For God and the King,'
cried the crusading Christians, as they seized
the Heaven-sent flag, and again charged their
enemy, who now fled in terror. The victory
was won, and the <i>Dannebrog</i>, from that hour,
became the sacred national standard of Denmark.</p>

<p>"Now I'm coming to the 'king in a bag'
story, Karl," said Valdemar. "Denmark's
power was now supreme throughout Scandinavia,
Northern Germany and even over to
Russia. Valdemar's reign was at its height.
His people adored him. But there were secret
foes&mdash;the conquered princes of Germany&mdash;awaiting
his downfall. Among them was one
in particular called Black Henry, who hated
Valdemar, and was biding his chance to overthrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
if not to kill him. All in one single
night the treacherous deed was done. Wearied
by a day spent in hunting, the King and his
son slept that night in a small, unguarded tent
in the woods of the little island on Lyö. Suddenly
their slumber was broken into by an
unseen foe. The King could scarcely move,
or speak, or see, or breathe. Black Henry had
fallen upon King Valdemar and his son, bound,
gagged and tied them up into two bags, and
fled with his royal captives to a waiting boat
in the river, and hurried them to Germany,
where they were thrown into prison.</p>

<p>"Some years after, the King was ransomed
by his loyal people with gold and lands, and
he finally returned to his beloved Denmark
amid the greatest rejoicing, to find most of his
splendor gone. He was no longer king of a
great empire, but he had his people's love,
and spent his remaining years faithfully improving
all the laws of his country."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, what glorious stories you do tell!"
exclaimed Karl, who, with Karen, had been
listening spell-bound to the end. "I shall
never again see the famous old <i>Dannebrog</i>,
without thinking of that wonderful story of
how it fell from heaven, and saved the battle
for the Danes."</p>

<p>"If Valdemar never makes his mark in the
world as a celebrated sculptor, he certainly will
as a great historian, with that memory of his,"
said his mother, indulgently. The afternoon
sun was sinking in the west as they made their
way down the mountainside, and soon left beautiful
old Himmelbjaerg far behind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE STORY OF THE DANISH "AHLHEDE"</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> they were tramping past wind-tossed
rye-fields and through sweet-smelling meadows
from which, every now and then, a long-legged
stork flapped its wings and flew skyward at
their approach.</p>

<p>Their way to the boats of pretty Tul Lake,&mdash;gleaming
through the trees in the sunlight,&mdash;lay
along the banks of the Gudenna River,
which has its source among the picturesque
hills near Veile; then meanders northward
through ranges of hills and green fields, winding
with many a bend and curve on past old
Himmelbjaerg, past Silkeborg and Randers,
finally emptying through Randers Fjord into
the Kattegat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you looking for the row-boats?" came
a sweet voice just behind them. "They are
just around the bend. I will show you the
way."</p>

<p>Turning in the direction of the voice, Valdemar
saw a pretty, rosy-cheeked, blue-eyed little
peasant girl, in embroidered bodice and cap,
carrying a great arm-load of poppies and forget-me-nots,
and, stiltily walking along the
middle of the road back of her, was a great
white, red-billed stork.</p>

<p>"There are the boats now," she said, pointing
down a wooded bank just ahead of them,
and turning to go. Fru Ingemann offered her
a small coin with her thanks and a smile, but
the proud child refused the coin with an indignant:
"<i>Nej tak! Ingenting! Ingenting!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
and started on her way,&mdash;the stork still following
in stately tread.</p>

<p>"Is that your stork?" Karl couldn't help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
calling after her, for he thought it awfully
funny to see the big white stork
following a little girl in such friendly
fashion.</p>

<p>"My stork? Why, no! I have no stork,"
laughed the merry-faced little peasant maid.
"But there is a stork's nest on the top of the
white church tower over there, and another one
up on farmer Andersen's chimney, where he
placed an old wagon wheel last year for them.
And over yonder, in the eaves of the village
houses, there must be several hundred storks.
They are very tame, and often follow the
plough in search of food for their nestlings,
which they find in the newly-turned earth. This
is their nesting time now. Then, when fall
comes, they will fly with their little ones down
to France and Egypt for the winter. But the
same storks always come back. This same one
followed me about last year. I think it knows
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>In Karl's land there were no friendly, red-legged
storks stalking about the country roads,
but he had read all about them in his "Andersen's
Fairy Tales."</p>

<p>"Storks bring happiness and good luck,"
explained Valdemar, "and to kill a stork in
Denmark is a greater crime, if anything, than
to kill a fox in England."</p>

<p>As the boat moved out into the blue lake,
through the silent reeds and water-lilies along
the shore, with its drowsy white swans, Karl
could still see in the distance the little peasant
girl with her wild-flowers, the stork in the middle
of the road still keeping stately pace with
her. Then he burst out laughing at the funny
sight.</p>

<p>Valdemar and Karl were both good oarsmen,
and so they rowed far out across the lake,
then drifted lazily along, while Fru Ingemann
entertained them with one of Evald's charming
fairy-tales, parts of Öhlenschläger's delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
"Aladdin," and tales from old Danish Saga-lore.</p>

<p>"Mother, won't you sing something?"
begged Valdemar, who always loved to hear
his mother's beautiful voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, while you are both rowing back to
shore, for it is growing late," said Fru Ingemann,
as she began and sang for them one of
Weyses's old Saga-like romances.</p>

<p>The cool evening breezes, whispering among
the trees, told them that the long, happy day
was over, and that they must catch their train
back to Aarhus at once.</p>

<p>Then came the day when they went by boat
down the coast and sailed up Veile Fjord, to
spend two happy days at the Munkebjerg,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
with many a ramble through the woods, guided
to and from all the loveliest views by following
the red or the yellow arrows on the trees,
pausing now and then, after a stiff climb, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
rest a moment in front of some little wooden
chalet, or to sit and enjoy the scene from Atilla's
Bench or Baron Lovenskjold's Bench, if
they had followed the red route, or at Ryeholm's
Bench or The Bench of the Four-Leaved
Clover, when they had followed the yellow
marks.</p>

<p>And from Munkebjerg they had gone to
Jellinge, a town perched upon the breezy upland,
and there they saw the two large, flat-topped,
heather-covered "barrows," or graves,
of Gorm the Old and Queen Thyra, of which
Valdemar had been telling them, and Karl was
surprised to hear that there still remained in
Zealand, alone, some thousands of these Viking
cairns, or Warrior's Hills, as they are
called.</p>

<p>Then, as the end of their short week drew
near, the children begged Fru Ingemann to
take them by motor-car to Randers, where the
famous annual Horse-Fair was being held, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
they strolled through the streets of the cheerful
old town, with its quaint old houses with their
slanting roofs and protruding windows.</p>

<p>The Danish flag, with its sharp white cross
on a blood-red field, fluttered everywhere.
Hundreds of them decorated the exhibition
field, to which the towns-folk and farmers, in
their Sunday-best, swarmed, from far and near,
to hear the speeches and witness the awarding
of prizes to the superbly groomed, arch-necked
horses of the famous Jutland breed.</p>

<p>The children had hoped to see the peasants
still wearing Hessian boots and velvet coats
covered with great silver buttons, but Fru Ingemann
told them it was fifty years too late
for that. They bought tickets&mdash;little bits of
blue and white ribbon with "Randers" and the
date printed on them&mdash;to the cake-man's
booth, and there they bought all sorts of cakes
fantastically made into queer-shaped men and
horses and hearts, all covered with sugar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
almonds and candies, each with a little motto
on it.</p>

<p>Karen soon grew tired and sleepy, so they
did not stay to witness the general fun and
frolic and peasant dancing at night. As they
left the grounds Karl, who was beginning to
learn a few Danish words, exclaimed at an
advertisement he saw on a signboard: <i>Industriforeningsbygningen!</i><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
"Valdemar, is all that
just one word?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just one word, Karl," replied his cousin.</p>

<p>"As we are all to leave Monday morning
for the Park, and Randers is half-way there,"
said Fru Ingemann, "I have decided not to
return to Aarhus at all, but to remain here over
Sunday."</p>

<p>No one wanted to go anywhere on Sunday,
so the day was quietly passed at home. In
Monday morning's mail came a letter from
Uncle Thor, asking how soon Valdemar could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
start up to Skagen, and also a telegram from
Uncle Oscar, saying: "Meet me at noon,
Monday, at Ribald. Pleasant surprise for
Karl."</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Else, what <i>can</i> father's surprise
be? I don't see how I can ever wait to find
out." But his aunt only advised him to be
more patient, for he would soon know.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about the Heath then, Aunt
Else, and this Park, where we are going," said
Karl, as their train sped rapidly northward
through the low moorland hills, past clover
fields where herds of fat red Danish cattle
stood separately tethered; past prosperous little
farms, some of them with their waving
rye-fields, others all aglow with yellowing
grain.</p>

<p>"Long, long ago," began Fru Ingemann,
"in the days when Grandmother Ingemann
was only a little girl, before there was any telegraphs
or telephones, the very heart of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Jutland&mdash;as large a space as the whole island
of Zealand&mdash;was just a dangerous, wild, barren
desert, all sand and peat-bogs. The few
Heath-dwellers who tried to live there led very
lonely and dangerous lives. The Natmaend, a
strange race of gypsy robbers, smugglers and
kidnappers, wandered there. History records
many dark tragedies enacted on the Heath.
It was on Grathe Heath that young King Valdemar
the Great met and overpowered his
treacherous enemy, Svend; and, a century later,
the Heath was the scene of a still grimmer
tragedy, the murder of King Erik by Marsk
Stig.</p>

<p>"The Ahlhede, or All-Heath, as the Danes
called it, had not always been a desert-land,
covered for miles with Viking barrows. There
had once been beautiful forests of spruce and
oak and fir-trees stretching over this four thousand
miles of waste land. But what forests the
long droughts and merciless west winds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
cold blasts from the North Sea failed to destroy
the ancient Vikings and their subjects cut
down for their ships, huts and for fuel, leaving
only a great silent, desolate, desert land.
It remained thus for such ages that no one ever
believed that it could be reclaimed,&mdash;that is,
no one until Captain Dalgas set to working
out his dreams and theories for conquering it.
His hope was to win back to Denmark, through
the conquering of the Heath, the territory lost
through the Schlesvig-Holstein war. He
formed the Heath Society and replanted the
treeless wastes.</p>

<p>"To-day, countless farmsteads, meadows
and pastures of the Danish peasantry dot the
Heath from Germany to the Skaw. Trees
again flourish; all has been changed as if by
magic, and the plough goes over more and
more acres of it every year, until a group of
patriotic Danes, like your Uncle Oscar, have
taken alarm lest all the breezy stretches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
heather be reduced to farms, and none of the
old-time Heath be preserved untouched for its
own natural beauty's sake."</p>

<p>"Uncle persuaded a lot of Danes away off in
Chicago, where he lives, to buy up a lot of the
wildest and most beautiful part of it so that
Denmark might keep it forever as a Park.
Isn't that it, mother?" questioned Valdemar.</p>

<p>"Yes, exactly, Valdemar," replied his
mother. "And, because of the untiring efforts
of a group of patriotic American Danes, like
your Uncle Oscar, a beautiful wild spot of
three hundred acres up in Northern Jutland,
near Ribald, has been purchased, and will be
formally presented to the Danish government
as a reservation, with the one condition that,
every year, in that spot, when Danish-Americans
cross the ocean to meet there and celebrate
their Fourth of July on Danish soil, the
Stars and Stripes shall float above Denmark's
sacred <i>Dannebrog</i>. Now that everything is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
ready, the Park is to be formally presented to
the Danish Government."</p>

<p>"Presented to-day, mother?" asked Karen
in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, this very afternoon. There will be a
great crowd. Every steamer for weeks past
has been bringing over hundreds of Americans,
and, Karl, look out, for you may
meet some of your Chicago friends among
them."</p>

<p>"From home, Aunt Else? There's nobody
I'd rather see from home than my own
mother!" said little Karl, rather wistfully.
"Gee! I do wish I could see my mother! I
just wonder what daddy's 'great surprise' can
be! Oh, just look at the big crowd!"</p>

<p>The train had stopped. "Ribald!" sang
out the conductor. In a twinkling the car was
emptied. As Fru Ingemann and her charges
reached the platform, Karl saw two waving
handkerchiefs making their way through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
dense crowd towards him, and in an instant
more he felt his mother's arms around
him.</p>

<p>"Mother! mother! I'm so glad you've
come!" he cried in joy. "Daddy, you did
give me a pleasant surprise!" He laughed
as Fru Ingemann and her sister Amalia greeted
each other.</p>

<p>"Aunt Amalia, won't you stay over here in
Denmark with us all summer?" urged Valdemar,
as the happy little party was being driven
rapidly on their way to the Park.</p>

<p>"Yes, Valdemar,&mdash;that is, I'm going to
remain until your Uncle Oscar can get back
from the United States again. That is why
I have come&mdash;so as to stay with Karl,
and let him see some more of Denmark,
during his father's absence. And then I'm
glad to see this wonderful Park, too, of
course."</p>

<p>"Why, Daddy! Must you go back to America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and leave us?" protested Karl, who was
having another surprise.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but business calls me back to
Chicago at once, my little Karl. I leave this
afternoon, immediately after the festivities, but
I'll come back again soon. Here we are at
the Park now."</p>

<p>As Mr. Hoffman, as president of the Danish-American
Park, took his place upon the speaker's
platform, and began his address, welcoming
the thousands of American visitors he saw
before him, back to the Fatherland,&mdash;to the
Park&mdash;<i>their</i> Park forever,&mdash;a great cheer
arose, which was redoubled in volume as the
Stars and Stripes were impressively hoisted
over the beloved <i>Dannebrog</i>&mdash;and then from
a thousand voices the Star Spangled Banner
floated forth over the Danish hills.</p>

<p>There were complimentary speeches by both
the American and Danish ministers, and by
Crown Prince Christian. Then every one sang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
one of those beautiful old national songs the
Danes love so well to sing in their woods, and
Karl told Valdemar and Karen the story of the
"Birth of Old Glory,"&mdash;as the United States
flag is sometimes called.</p>

<p>In the evening, the whole forest seemed one
vast fairy-land, with its myriad sparkling lights,
strains of soft music, gay crowds and waving
flags. Multitudes of lamps, of all colors and
sizes, swung from the trees, throwing a romantic
fairy-like light over the rustling beech-trees.
Torches had been stuck wherever it had
been possible to fasten them, and here and
there a huge bon-fire flung its lurid glare
over the whole scene, sending up great volumes
of black smoke into the darkness overhead.</p>

<p>Three very tired and sleepy children were
those whom Fru Ingemann put to bed that
night, even before their usual time. The happiness
of the long day&mdash;so full of new sights,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
surprises and excitement for Valdemar as well
as Karl&mdash;was only marred by the leave-taking
of Uncle Oscar for his long trip back to his
home in far-away Chicago.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>SKAGEN</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> Valdemar it seemed like a week, rather
than just three days, since he had bidden good-bye
to his mother, Karen and Aunt Amalia,
and brought Karl with him up to the little
painter's village of Skagen on the Kattegat,
where they were to spend the months of July
and August visiting Uncle Thor, who had built
for himself one of the most charming of all the
pretty, long, low, vine-covered homes of the
famous Artist-Colony, of which he, as Court
Painter, was by far the most distinguished
member.</p>

<p>Up here was Uncle Thor's summer studio,
with its row of fifteen great windows between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
which glorious red hollyhocks towered almost
up to the red roof-tiles. On the south, the
windows overlooked a gay, flower-massed garden
where, on warm summer afternoons, the
great sculptor loved to chat with painter-friends,
and serve tea under his wind-swept old
elms.</p>

<p>Here, in this bare and lofty studio, with its
half-finished paintings and groups in clay, and,
if the day be chilly, its crackling wood hearth-fire
at the further end, throwing a flickering,
rosy light over all,&mdash;here Valdemar was to
spend many hard, long hours every day under
his gifted godfather's instruction.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i139.jpg" width="341" height="500" alt="boy watching sculptor" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">"In the centre of the studio stood the unfinished statue of the little Crown Prince"</span></div>
</div>

<p>"In the whole of Denmark was there ever
any boy half so fortunate?" thought Valdemar
to himself, as he made a mental resolution
to show Uncle Thor his appreciation by
the hardest work of his life. Valdemar could
work hard, and he meant not only to prove to
his uncle what earnest toil and definite purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
could do, but also to win his offer to send him
to the Academy in the fall.</p>

<p>On a low platform, in the centre of the
studio, stood the unfinished statue of the little
Crown Prince Olaf of Norway which Uncle
Thor had commenced in Copenhagen at the
Royal Palace. Day by day it was nearing completion.</p>

<p>"And here," said Valdemar's great teacher,
uncovering a smaller but similar clay figure of
the same charming subject, "is work my ambitious
little pupil is to finish before he leaves
Skagen. It will be hard work, Valdemar, and
it will put your ability as a young sculptor to
a fine test. But you can do it, Valdemar, and
do it creditably, too!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Thor! Do you really think
so? I'll try hard enough!" promised the lad
as he set to work in good earnest.</p>

<p>The long hours, which Valdemar spent daily
in the studio, Karl passed either out of doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
or in reading all the fascinating books on
Danish history in Uncle Thor's library.</p>

<p>There were frequent letters to both boys
from Fanö, the little island in the North Sea,
where Karen, her mother, and Aunt Amalia
were spending the summer. Later they were
going to spend a few weeks on a large farm,
for a change.</p>

<p>And so the weeks passed. Finally Holme
Week, with its clear, bright evenings, came;
but the midsummer sun was growing uncomfortably
warm even as far north as
Skagen.</p>

<p>Valdemar's work on his little Prince Olaf
statue was so far advanced that Uncle Thor
readily consented when the two boys begged
him to let them take the dog, Frederik, along
with them, and tramp over the two miles of
mountainous sand-ridges which led to Denmark's
most northern point, Grenen, or the
Gren,&mdash;a mere desolate sand-reef, the last little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
tip of Jutland's mainland, which extends between
the waters of the North Sea and the
Baltic.</p>

<p>The only signs of life the boys passed on the
way, as they trudged along together, often
ankle-deep in the sand, were a few long-legged
birds, and several huge hares which shot across
the road in front of them.</p>

<p>"We didn't bring along more than half the
sand-hills with us, did we, Valdemar?" laughed
Karl, as they threw themselves down on the
beach at Grenen, emptied the sand from their
shoes, and donned their bathing suits.</p>

<p>"Talking about sand, Karl, some day I must
show you all that remains of an old Gothic
church tower near Skagen. One day, during a
service, a great sand-storm came up and buried
the church itself so suddenly that the only escape
the people had was from the belfry. That
is all that can be seen of that church even
to-day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederik barked loudly and dashed back
and forth after the two boys, who were soon
bubbling over with the fun and excitement of
dipping their feet first into the breakers of the
Skager-Rak, and then into the waters of the
Kattegat, the warm July salt wind and spray
tanning their bare arms and faces. Then,
Frederik following, Valdemar swam far out
into the sea and back again, with the utmost
ease. All Danish boys can swim well, and Valdemar
wanted to give Karl a demonstration of
his ability as an expert swimmer.</p>

<p>"Kattegat! Skager-Rak!" shouted Karl,
who liked something in the sound of the words.
"Grenen's great! But, honest, Valdemar,
never in my life did I expect to bathe in both
these raging seas at once! But here I go&mdash;look
now!" and he plunged out into the breakers.
Frederik dashed after him to make sure
that he was safe, then came bounding back
again to Valdemar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ow! ow!" cried Karl, limping back on
one foot.</p>

<p>"Crabber?" inquired Valdemar. "Uncle
Thor warned us to look out for crabs and
shrimps up here on the beach. You sit down
here and rest, Karl. I'm going to gather
some of those fine sea-gull's feathers scattered
along the beach for you to take back
home with you for your collection of Danish
souvenirs. It was mighty nice of Uncle
Thor to give you that letter from King
Frederik!"</p>

<p>"And I'm going to put my shoes and stockings
right back on again while you're gone!"
said Karl, surveying his painful foot with a
frown.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, Karl!" exclaimed Valdemar, as
he soon came running back, his arms full of
something. "Look what I've found for you!
Sea-gulls' eggs! All greenish, with brown peppery
spots on them, and here's a lot of the loveliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
white wing-feathers, every one tipped with
black! They're all for you, Karl."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Valdemar. Let's blow the
eggs. Do you know how?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. I've got a piece of wire
in my pocket. You just run this wire straight
through both ends&mdash;so! Then blow and
blow!"</p>

<p>Together the boys had soon blown all the
eggs, and tied them up with the feathers in
a piece of old fish-net they found on the beach.
Then Karl watched Valdemar while he made a
hasty sketch of Skagen Fyr, the great white
lighthouse towering above the sand-hummocks
near the Signal Station, where it is said that
every year seventy thousand ships are signalled.</p>

<p>As they started on their two-mile tramp over
the desolate sand-ridges back to Skagen, Valdemar
gave one last lingering look towards the
wild, wind-swept stretch of endless beach they
were leaving, where the North Sea and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Baltic have battled against each other for countless
ages, with one ceaseless roar. Back of
them, range after range of low shifting sand-dunes
glistened in the sun, as they stretched
towards the unbroken horizon in every direction.
It was a strange new world to both
boys.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking so long about, Valdemar?"
asked Karl.</p>

<p>"Oh, Karl, it was off there that our noble
Tordenskjold's little frigate, <i>White Eagle</i>, pursued
the great Swedish man-of-war <i>Ösel</i>, and
made her fly in terror. There's something
about the very desolation of this place that, I
like," said Valdemar. "Something strange,
and picturesque, and romantic, I mean, Karl.
One feels some way&mdash;up here at the Gren&mdash;as
though he had actually reached the world's
end! I'd like to come back up here often.
Wouldn't you, Karl?"</p>

<p>"No! There's something I don't like one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
bit about it! I liked the Massachusetts Cape
Cod beach at home; but that was different.
I'd hate to have to live very long anywhere
near here! Romantic isn't the right word,
Valdemar. It's a lonely, wild, and forsaken
spot, with nothing at all 'romantic' about it
in my eyes. To me it feels like the 'jumping
off place,' all right. And I've heard, too, Valdemar,
that when a great storm is blowing, and
the waves are rolling mountain high, that there
are just terrible shipwrecks up here at this
dangerous point! Down at the Skagen Hotel,
the figureheads and name-boards, that they
have collected from ships of all nations, tell
the tale, Valdemar."</p>

<p>"That's true. There was the wreck of the
<i>Daphne</i>, with the lives of eight of the brave
life-saving crew lost. Sometimes there are
twenty shipwrecks a year. But, Karl, this is
the sea that made Vikings! Over these same
seas, where our smoky steamers now pass, once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
danced <i>Long Ship</i>, <i>Serpent</i> and <i>Dragon</i>, with
their gilded dragon-beaks gleaming in the sunlight!
Can't you see them, Karl? I can!
Uncle Thor has often told me the wonderful
Viking tales. And I've read about their marvellous
courage and daring. The Eddas and
Sagas of the Vikings are rich in lore of those
fiery-hearted warriors, who sailed over the
stormy seas in their fleets of light ash-wood
ships, conquering far and wide, and meeting
death light-heartedly! They say some great
Viking chief is buried near here. Their cairns
and barrows by thousands cover Denmark to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've read about them at home," answered
Karl, who loved courage and bravery
as much as did any healthy American boy, but
who loved also to tease. "They were just a
race of bold sea-robbers, and pirates, always
'hatching their felonious little plans,' always
ready to burn and kill; and, according to history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
some of the deaths they dealt out to their
enemies were truly 'Vikingish.'"</p>

<p>"And yet, Karl, the ancient Sagas and chronicles
tell that it was our brave Vikings who
first of all discovered your North America,
and founded a colony they called Vineland,
near where your great Harvard College is to-day.
The Sagas say that, five hundred years
before Columbus lived, Viking Biarne sailed
to America with his ship <i>Eyrar</i>, and that, later,
Lief, a son of Eric the Red, went over to America,
too."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. I've read Longfellow's poem,
'The Skeleton in Armor,' and I've seen the
'Old Mill' at Newport, which was long believed
to be a Viking relic," said Karl. "But
we know differently now. Nothing has been
really proved."</p>

<p>The sun was sinking in the west as the two
tired, but happy boys reached the outskirts of
the straggling little village of Skagen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
trudged down the sandy road which led in and
out among the fishermen's huts, with their
tarred or heavily thatched roofs, and color-washed walls&mdash;some
of them even built from
wreckage.</p>

<p>Strings of fish, strung from pole to pole, were
hung out to dry. Groups of sturdy fish-wives,
here and there, with bronzed arms bare to the
shoulder, and prettily kerchiefed heads, sat at
tubs, dressing flounders for drying; and from
the doorway of one hut came a voice so sweet
and clear, crooning a quaint old Danish lullaby
to the sleeping baby in the mother's arms, that
the boys paused to listen as she sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Den lille Ole, med Paraplyen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Han kender alle Smaa Folk i Byen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hver lille Pige, hver lille Dreng,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">De sover sodt i deres lille Seng."</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>"That was a pretty song. Tell me what it
was all about," asked Karl, as they hurried on
at a more rapid gait, for they were getting
hungrier every minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it was just a little folk-song every Dane
knows. She was singing to her baby about the
'Sandman,' or <i>den lille Ole</i>, as we Danes say.
She was telling him that the 'Sandman, with
his umbrella, knows all about the little folks
in town. Each little girl&mdash;each little boy&mdash;they
are all sleeping sweetly in their beds.'"</p>

<p>They passed an old fisherman, mackintosh-clad,
and another one in jersey and high boots,
both hurrying towards the beach, where, in the
gathering twilight, they could see a dim craft,
a small fishing boat, with a few dark figures
plying their trade, slowly rounding the promontory,
its lights reflecting picturesquely in the
water.</p>

<p>"Some day we must come back earlier, when
more of the fishermen are home from their
trips, and watch the crews at practice," said
Valdemar. "These Skagen fishermen are true
sons of the Vikings. It is said that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
one, once, who boasted of having saved two
hundred lives."</p>

<p>"I hope you didn't worry about our getting
home so late, Uncle Thor," said Valdemar, at
the supper table that night.</p>

<p>"No, but here is a letter for you."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" exclaimed Valdemar, as he finished
reading it. "It's from mother. She
says that Grandmother Ingemann has invited
us all to spend Christmas with her down in
Odense, and that Aage will be home for his
vacation from the Military College, and be
there with us, and Uncle Oscar, too, will be
back again from America. Mother has decided
that I am not to return to school until after
Christmas, for she thinks that Karl and I are
learning more by seeing our country than
we could learn in school. And, best of all,
mother says that I can remain up here
studying with you, Uncle Thor, until
September!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said Karl. "No school until
New Year's for me!"</p>

<p>"That means five more weeks up here with
you, dear Uncle Thor!" continued Valdemar.
"Now I can entirely finish the task you gave
me to do, the Prince Olaf statue. I'm so glad,
Uncle Thor!"</p>

<p>"And I'm glad, too, Valdemar, for you are
doing me great credit as a pupil. I am going
to be very proud of that statue of yours, Valdemar,
when it is finished."</p>

<p>These last five weeks passed for Valdemar
much as the first five had&mdash;in the
studio.</p>

<p>"Study&mdash;diligent, earnest and honest,"
said Uncle Thor, "will win many honors for
you when you are older, Valdemar. If you
work hard, you should some day gather some
of the roses that strew the path of the Danish
artist, my boy."</p>

<p>"But once you said that Denmark was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
overcrowded with art students, Uncle
Thor, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"That is true. But many of them fail to
go on with their work; they lose courage and
drop out. Others become interested in something
else, and so leave their art studies. The
few who do keep on usually learn all they can
from the art schools in Denmark, and then go
to Italy for further study."</p>

<p>"Yes, as you did, Uncle Thor, and as Thorvaldsen
did, too," said Valdemar. "Oh, Uncle
Thor! Do you think that, when I am older,
I may ever be able to study in Italy?"</p>

<p>"My dear little Valdemar, anything is possible

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>A DANISH PEASANT WEDDING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Karen's</span> fair skin was tanned so many
shades darker than her flaxen locks that Valdemar
and Karl hardly knew her. Far down
on the delightful <i>Vesterhavet</i>,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> on the sandy
little island of Fanö, she had spent the happy
summer-time with her mother and Aunt Amalia,
first at the seashore, and later on the great
farm of Peder Sörensen, near Nordby, where,
most of the time, she had played out of doors
in the sun and wind.</p>

<p>The merry harvest season had passed soon
after Valdemar and Karl had arrived. They
remembered how the harvesters had laid aside
the last sheaf, decorated it with flowers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
ribbons, and carried it in procession. Then had
followed the great <i>Höst Gilde</i>, or Harvest
Feast, a very festive function when sturdy men
and rosy-cheeked maidens danced hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>Then, later, in the same beautiful month of
October, had followed another folk-festival,
and Mortin's Day,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> when in the evening everybody
ate "Mortin's Goose," stuffed with boiled
apples and black fruit.</p>

<p>Sometimes, on some of the children's many
trips over to play on the beach by the West
Sea, they had brought back pieces of amber
washed up by the water. Karl found some
pretty big pieces to add to his rapidly growing
collection of Danish souvenirs, which now included
not only the coral specimens, sea-gull's
eggs and wing-feathers, but Fanö amber, and,
best of all, Uncle Thor's gift of the great white
envelope and letter from the Royal Palace.</p>

<p>Peder Sörensen was not a farmer himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Like most of the men of Fanö, he was a sailor.
It was the Fanö wives who, in their picturesque
though rather unbecoming dress, cultivated
the land, drove the cattle to pasture and
the sheep to graze among the sand-hills, and it
was they who milked the fine "Red Danish"
cows at night, and made the far-famed "Best
Danish" butter, with which they welcomed
home their seafaring husbands.</p>

<p>Fru Anna Sörensen, who had studied farming
and dairying at the Agricultural College,
always presented a neat and attractive appearance
in her dark blue dress with its one note
of bright color down around the very hem, and
her quaint red and blue kerchief head-dress,
with its inevitable loose ends, which Valdemar
graphically described as "rabbit's ears."</p>

<p>All the women of Fanö dressed just so, except,
of course, upon some great occasion like
Lowisa Nielsen's wedding, which was to take
place in November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost before they knew it, the short summer
had flown, and November, with its cool,
bright days, had come, bringing Lowisa Nielsen's
wedding invitation, which the <i>Bydemand</i>,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
in white trousers, topboots, and a nosegay in
his buttonhole, carried over to the Sörensens
on horseback.</p>

<p>For propriety's sake, Fru Sörensen allowed
him to knock a second time before opening the
door, then politely asked him within.</p>

<p>"Greetings from the father and mother, and
Lowisa, to yourself, your husband and guests,"
he began, as he took the proffered seat. "Your
presence is truly desired at the wedding on
Thursday next at ten o'clock. Come early,
accompany the bridal party to the church, and
hear their marriage service, return with them
for dinner, remain for supper, then amuse yourselves
with dancing and games the whole night;
and then come again the next day, and take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
your places from the first day, and they will
be sure to do the same for you when wanted
from choice, on some enjoyable occasion."</p>

<p>This unique invitation being delivered, the
<i>Bydemand</i> arose as if to go, but Fru Sörensen,
with Danish hospitality, and according to an
old custom, quickly produced a flagon of home-brewed
beer, and a raisin-decorated wheaten
cake, which she offered him.</p>

<p>As he finished the flagon and was about to
leave, he turned at the door to add, as though
an afterthought: "Then you must not forget
to send a convenient amount of butter,
eggs, a pail of fresh milk and two jars of
cream."</p>

<p>"I will gladly," replied Fru Sörensen, as he
departed.</p>

<p>On the wedding morning, at the appointed
time, Fru Anna Sörensen and her guests, Fru
Ingemann, Mrs. Hoffman, and the children,
who had never seen a peasant wedding before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
drove over to the great Nielsen <i>Bonnegaard</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
passed through the massive stone gateway, and
into the open courtyard. They were graciously
received by Fru Nielsen, and seated with the
other guests upon wooden benches ranged
around the walls of a spacious family apartment,
whose polished rafters converged into a
sharp-spiked peak at the centre.</p>

<p>Lowisa, a fair-haired, blue-eyed Danish peasant
maiden, to-day looked unusually attractive,
decked out in bridal array,&mdash;a pretty but tight-fitting
homespun, escaping the floor all around
by several inches. From Lowisa's richly gold-embroidered,
tall scarlet cap, or "hood," as
the Danes call it, hung pendent innumerable
brilliant ornaments&mdash;round balls of metal and
other fantastic dangles, all waving and twinkling
as she moved. Extending from the back
were vast bows and streamers of scarlet ribbon,
under which she wore a head-dress of very rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and delicate lace. And the filmy white fichu,
which crossed over her bosom, disclosed a
rounded throat, circled by a bangle necklace of
gold and silver coins.</p>

<p>As soon as the last guest had arrived, the
whole party was driven over to the church,&mdash;the
bride and her family in the forward "rock-away,"
the bridegroom in the next, then, in
another, a band of rustic musicians, who, as
soon as all the guests were seated in the different
vehicles, struck up a lively air.</p>

<p>At the proper moment, the bridegroom,
young Nils Rasmussen, a fine-looking fellow
of true Saxon type, took his position beside
Lowisa at the altar.</p>

<p>On returning to the house, the little church
party was met by an eager, expectant company
of guests, who had been invited to join them for
the wedding-dinner. The bridal couple took
their places at the middle of the cross-tables,
which were arranged to form a square, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the fashion of ancient banquet tables, and,
when all the guests were seated, the serving-maids
brought in great bowls of steaming rice,
and placed four to each table, deftly dividing
the contents of each into as many sections, by
making deep cross-shaped indentures, into which
they sprinkled cinnamon and sugar and poured
a cupful of hot butter. Then each guest, four
to a bowl, lifted his spoon, dipped it into the
delicious <i>gröd</i>, and began to eat. Meats followed,
with wheaten cakes, highly decorated,
and home-brewed beer of a very peculiar, rich,
honeyed taste, and with the singing of a beautiful
old Danish hymn the repast was brought
to a close.</p>

<p>Then the room was cleared and the dancing
began. It was certainly a beautiful
sight, with every one decked out in festive
attire.</p>

<p>"<i>Nie tak</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> coyly refused each girl upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
her first invitation to dance, according to an
old law of peasant decorum, which also prevented
the bridal couple, who led the dancing,
from speaking to, or even noticing each other
again during the entire festivities.</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on the dancing continued.
Between seven and eight, supper without
rice was served, followed immediately by
more dancing, which continued until four
o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock the next morning the fiddlers
had again arrived, and the dancing was renewed,
this time with a noticeable increase in
the number of rosy-cheeked, snowy-haired, elderly
couples, in quaint holiday dress of homespun,
with silver-buckled shoes. The bride
continued to dance gracefully and bravely on,
although paling cheeks told of her weariness.</p>

<p>Fru Nielsen explained that the third and last
day would only differ from the first in that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
would be fewer guests present, after which all
would begin making formal calls upon the
bride, which was considered the height of good
form.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>JUL-TIDE AT GRANDMOTHER INGEMANN'S</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A freshly</span> fallen, deep, feathery snow covered
Odense on Christmas Eve, and the merry
jingle of sleigh-bells was in the air, as the little
Ingemann party reached Fyen's prosperous
capital.</p>

<p>Grandmother Ingemann did not live within
the town itself, but a long drive in a big sleigh
brought her Christmas guests within sight of
the great old house with its many gables&mdash;all
of the oddest stairway design&mdash;where most of
her long, happy life had been lived.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/i167.jpg" width="338" height="500" alt="sleighs approaching house in snow" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">"'Welcome! and "Glaedelig Jul!'" called out both Grandfather and Grandmother Ingemann"</span></div>
</div>

<p>Although it was only the middle of the
wintry afternoon, darkness was fast gathering,
and from many a window on their way a candle's
soft glow shone out through the fluttering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
snow to guide the wayfarer to warmth and
cheer.</p>

<p>"Welcome! and <i>Glaedelig Jul!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> called
out both Grandfather and Grandmother Ingemann,
who, in spite of the cold, had appeared
on the door-step as the sleigh drew up.</p>

<p>"<i>Glaedelig Jul!</i>" cried Valdemar and Karen,
kissing their dear grandparents, as Fru Ingemann
introduced Aunt Amalia and cousin
Karl.</p>

<p>"Where's Uncle Thor, and where's Aage?"
demanded Valdemar as they entered the house.
"And where's Daddy? Didn't Daddy come?"
was Cousin Karl's first question.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear children, everybody's here," gently
answered Grandmother Ingemann, smiling
as she glanced out of the window.</p>

<p>Out rushed the children to welcome the sleigh
that came jingling up to the door, out of which
jumped Uncle Thor, Aage, and Uncle Oscar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
just back from the States. Such huggings and
greetings as then took place! Never had there
been such a happy Christmas family reunion
at Grandmother Ingemann's for long years and
years!</p>

<p>Since his mother had last seen him, Aage
had grown into a tall, broad-shouldered young
man who carried himself with such fine military
bearing&mdash;and preceded all his remarks with:
"In my regiment"&mdash;that Valdemar and Karl
soon idolized him. And as for skating&mdash;well,
he would show them something in the half hour,
or so, that still remained before the time to
start for the annual Christmas Eve service at
the little church on the hill.</p>

<p>Then it was Valdemar's turn to receive compliments.
Uncle Thor had great news! He
announced that his talented little pupil's work
had appeared at the Fall Exhibit of the Academy,&mdash;and
had won a prize!</p>

<p>"A prize at the Academy! Oh, Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Thor!" exclaimed Valdemar, throwing his
arms about his distinguished master's neck for
joy. "Dear Uncle Thor! You didn't even tell
me that my statue was to be entered at the
Academy Exhibit this fall! Oh, I am so
happy!"</p>

<p>Compliments showered upon him from
Grandfather, and Grandmother, and from his
own dear mother, and everybody, so fast that
he was glad to make his escape with Aage and
Karl, who were starting out to the frozen lake,
with their skates.</p>

<p>Aage and Valdemar, like all Danish boys,
were famous skaters. Karl was a fair one.
Soon the two brothers were outdoing each other
cutting figure-eights, hearts and arrows on the
ice, and Aage even cut the face of his sweetheart.
Then, as the music of a waltz Aunt
Amalia was playing reached them, they called:
"Come on, Karl, it's easy," and proceeded to
waltz on the ice as gracefully as if on a ballroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
floor. But Karl fell flat, and felt he had
made a miserable failure.</p>

<p>Then they all came rushing into the house
at the sight of several waiting sleighs at the
door, which reminded them that it must be
nearly time for the five o'clock Christmas Eve
service. Soon every one was bundled into
warm furs and crowded into the sleighs, servants
and all, and the happy little procession
made its way through the falling snow to the
church.</p>

<p>As they passed through the village streets
candle-lights gleamed from hundreds of windows,
and here and there the children caught
glimpses inside of brightly festooned little
Christmas trees, and of sheaves of wheat or
rye, fastened to the window-shutters out in the
snow for the birds; and, strangest of all, Karl
thought, were bowls of steaming hot oatmeal
standing on many door-steps. But his mother
explained to him that the bowls of oatmeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
were placed there for the good little <i>Jul-nissen</i>,
the Little People, or Christmas Nixies, the
knee-high, little red-jacketed old men, with
pointed red caps and long gray beards, who are
supposed to form a part of every good Danish
household.</p>

<p>When Grandmother's sleighing party entered
the little whitewashed church, and took the
places reserved for them, they found it already
full to overflowing, and a crowd gathering outside
as well.</p>

<p>The smiling priest in his dignified long black
gown and deep-gauffered white <i>Pibekrave</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
around his neck, joined heartily in the singing
of hymns and carols, which were re-echoed by
the voices of the greater throng standing out
in the snow. Then followed the Christmas
sermon, and the usual touching prayer "for
our brethren in South Jutland."</p>

<p>It was Holy Eve, the one night in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
year when services are held by candle-light,
and the myriad wax candles, burning on the
altar, threw a soft and mysterious light over
the spruce and laurel boughs decorating the
chancel.</p>

<p>The light snowfall had become a blinding
snow storm before the little procession of
sleighs had finally reached home, where the
great dinner of the year was awaiting them,
with its roast goose, stuffed with prunes and
chestnuts, its cinnamon-flavored rice pudding,
and a famous Danish dessert called <i>Röd Gröd</i>,
the repast ending with nuts, Christmas cakes,
candy and hot tea. Low over the table, illumined
with a dozen tiny, candle-lighted Christmas
trees, hung green festoons of laurel and
spruce with a secreted sprig of mistletoe; while
at every one's place were little mementoes,
stuffed Nixies, snappers, and a small Danish
flag,&mdash;except at Uncle Oscar's, Aunt Amalia's
and Karl's places, where the Stars and Stripes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
were thoughtfully combined with the <i>Dannebrog</i>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the dinner Grandfather
Ingemann arose and proposed a toast to "our
Danish-American guests,"&mdash;whereupon all
arose, touched glasses and drank, uttering the
word for health, "<i>Skaal!</i>" Again, Grandfather
Ingemann proposed the healths of "Our
illustrious Court Painter and his talented little
pupil,"&mdash;when all again arose with their host,
and the process was repeated. The last toast
was "for our absent friends," after which
Grandfather made a complimentary little
speech, wishing every one joy in the years to
come.</p>

<p>Then all withdrew to the drawing-room,
where the lights suddenly went out, and the
folding-doors of an adjoining room were flung
wide, where, in dazzling beauty, its topmost
boughs brushing the rafters, stood the great
Jule-tree. Then every one formed a circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
around the tree, and Grandfather distributed
a basket of hymn books, from which all joined
in singing that beautiful old Danish carol, "A
Child is Born in Bethlehem."</p>

<p>Then, to the soft notes of a violin, all joined
hands again, and slowly danced around the
tree, singing as they danced another beautiful
old carol. The servants were then called in,
and Grandfather Ingemann called off the
names, and distributed the presents. There
were so many gifts for every one, from little
Karen up to Grandfather Ingemann himself,
that the floor was soon covered deep with the
tissue-paper wrappings.</p>

<p>When the laughter and merrymaking had
reached its height, there came a sharp ring at
the door-bell, so sharp that every one paused
in strange expectation, and little Karen rushed
to the door after the maid. In the fast-falling
snow stood a tall man in a green uniform and
a three-cornered hat, who handed a great white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
envelope to the servant, with the words: "To
Valdemar Ingemann, from his Majesty, King
Frederik," then quickly departed.</p>

<p>Karen rushed breathlessly back to her mother
ahead of the serving-maid. "Oh, mother! It
was the King's <i>Jaeger!</i> Valdemar, it's for
you! For you!" she cried, as the awe-stricken
maid put into the boy's hands the great white
envelope inscribed with the words: "To Valdemar
Ingemann, from his Majesty, the
King."</p>

<p>Every one looked inquiringly at every one
else, but in the Court Painter's eye there lurked
a knowing twinkle.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother! <i>mother!</i> Oh, <i>Uncle Thor!</i>"
excitedly exclaimed the little artist, dancing
about the room. "It's from my friend the
King! He says he has visited the Academy
and seen with great pleasure my statue of little
Prince Olaf of Norway. He congratulates me
upon winning a prize, and, mother dear, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
wants to see me at the Palace, Thursday, at
one!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Even before Twelfth Night had come and
gone, the American relatives had said their
good-byes to Copenhagen and to the Ingemanns,
and sailed for New York. Valdemar,
accompanied by his Uncle Thor, had made the
call at the Palace, and been entered as a student
at the Academy, with the King's promise to him
of long years of study in Rome just as soon as
he was ready for it. So we too will bid good-bye
to our ambitious little Danish Cousin, with
his rose-colored dreams of the future.</p>
